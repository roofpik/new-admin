I have been living here with my colleagues from the same hotel for 2yrs and a couple of months and it\ufffds quite an amazing place to live. The security is good here as you have guards everywhere around the society; there are 24X7 CCTV cameras and proper security verification procedures are taken care off. The place gets really secluded after 9pm as you will find really less people moving around in this society after 9pm. There are a lot of green areas here and one garden which is a jungle like area for kids to play. Amenities like clubhouse are there which has a TT table in it and no one actually uses the clubhouse here apart from playing Table Tennis. The parking is better here as every house has been allotted with 1 car parking space and a separate space for visitors parking as well. The infrastructure is by far good here but the buildings are getting old and maintenance is done only once a year. Apart from that this place is really good to live as the neighbours are really good, they are friendly and really caring,so we get a homely feeling here.",

They have fixed timings for example, at 5pm they would open the gate for half an hour or sometimes for one hour because residents come in so it becomes difficult for them to open it repeatedly,after that it gets closed. When visitors come in they enter their name in the register and only after confirmation they are allowed to enter,for this purpose we have started with installation of intercoms in every flat for safety purpose and ease as well. As its a Huda building, we can't do much on to lawn area or sports related area as they have their proper norms for everything. But yes, for recreation we have a community hall at the top which is used occasionally (not always). As the society is barely 2 years old so not many festivals and events have been celebrated here so far, but last year they celebrated new year's eve. So it\u2019s all good, safe, calm and  it is a peaceful society. Parking is allotted to every resident here so we don\u2019t face any parking issues as such.",

As I have Arthritis problem so I find it really difficult to climb down the stairs so I always use the lifts which is fully functional all the time and it is quite good for me. There are frequent power cuts but we have got generators installed which give full electricity back up. There is no kids play area here as when my kids play football, guards sometimes stop them because cars are parked and could cause damage to window panes. Parking is very good and decent enough and not that congested.",

There is a community hall at the top ( 8th floor) which are given to the residents after permission and prior payment. Lift is not maintained well. The parks are really small for kids and they do not like to play there as the space is not sufficient for them, so they use normal inside roads which is sometimes very dangerous as they play football, volleyball and cars are parked so window panes can break. As such there is no clubhouse or activities present except one community hall upstairs. There are no CCTV cameras installed in this society. So I don\u2019t find the society that safe.

If any person needs to organize an event in the lawn he/she has to give some nominal amount and can host a party by getting their cook and other necessary items for the function. Lift is there in the apartment. Being a tenant I can say that staying here is good and safe. Altogether it is a good environment with spacious rooms and flats are well maintained by the respective head.  The only disadvantage of this apartment is that outside the main gate we have bad roads, dusty environment and also there is a left over land and the village area or people nearby create mess in the area after eating anything. They throw the garbage at any place, which I haven't seen in the foreign countries. People should be responsible enough to take care for the welfare of this area and should dispose of things at the right place.",

Sports facilities are there like, basketball court, badminton court is there and having kids play area within the society helps theparents to keep an eye on their kids. Parking is very bad with not enough parking space being available. If I park one car there then you cannot park the second car, so there is a space problem in parking.

Guards are appointed at every 30-40 miles gap, which provides good security. Amenities are average. There are 10 to 20 parks here which is amazing and also the kids are allowed to play there. Parking is poor as the slots are not allocated to everyone and just an open parking is there. No extra charges for car parking are taken. Seepage and sewage issues are there.Having one's own invertors or generator is feasible because there is no power backup in this area. Housemaids are easily available at a nominal price. This place is favourable for senior citizens too. I chose this place because it is near to my work place, easily accessible and my all requirements are fulfilled. In addition, RWA is working very well.",

There is an open parking, which is a good thing, but in peak hours there is not a single place to park. Infrastructure is good but building is too dingy as the construction is old and maintenance has not been given not priority by them. House cleaners are difficult to find, it takes 3 months to get one and they charge Rs 1000/m for 1 BHK. This place is not friendly for bachelors.

There is no clubhouse or any kind of sports courts, but there are small kids play areas which is pretty good. There are two parks which are well maintained. Parking facility is good here; there are covered parking spaces, open parking spaces which are allotted for the residents and separate parking spaces for the visitors too and they are enough in number. As this is a CGHS and there is no involvement of any builder the infrastructure is excellent and there have been no complaints so far regarding seepage issues or anything related to the infrastructure. A new high school is being constructed just in front of the society and there is a play school too. It is very close to the HUDA market plus there is a store within the society so everything is easily available. We have 24x7 electricity supply and there is 80% power back up too. The events are celebrated very well with DJ\u2019s, music etc. and everyone enjoys the events.",

They have CCTV's around but I do not know if they are working or not. They do not have any clubhouse in Tatvam.We have to give maintenance, which is very high, but it is mostly for gardener or security. They do not have any specific reason for that. There is a kids play area, which is good, and the sports facilities where we have a cricket pitch where we have tennis, basketball, badminton courts. Definitely, there is lots of greenery and open spaces which are very well maintained regularly but what they do is that they encourage the owner to pick up the poop and all that. The owner has to take them outside the society. The residents have two reserve parking but if you have more than two cars then you have to park in the visitors parking which is dedicated for visitors who always face a problem. Infrastructure is bad as we are facing seepage problem,the walls are moist during winter, and water palms break down. Water is regular but not clean because sometimes we see white stuff in the water like chlorine and you cannot drink directly from the tap. You have to install RO for that.The senior citizen has a day, which is senior citizen day in a year that is all, which they have.",

There\u2019s neither a gym facility here nor any in-house grocery store, but there are a lot of sports facilities available in this society. Parking is available for the residents but if the owner has more than 2 cars then parking becomes a problem.For visitors there\u2019s one parking lot space available, but in case of a party here then we have to inform the guards about it who arrange for more parking facility.The construction quality is just average here and we often face seepage issues, maintenance staff like the plumber needs to be more  efficient.The houses here lack privacy as you can see what\u2019s happening in the other house through the window but apart from that the layout is efficient in a 1000sqft yard.There is ample spacious rooms here and we have a pretty good lawn too,as I love pets we have 3 pets here and this place is quite pet friendly.Since it\u2019s a well gated community and the security is also pretty efficient and effective here, we don\u2019t need to close the doors of our house as it\u2019s safe and secure living here.CCTV cameras are always operational and guards are always present.The area is conveniently located near various malls and hospitals and maids are very easily available here.The society is pretty quiet and peaceful.The community living is great here as I can see people engaging in a lot of various activities.",

It is a gated community with guards so no security issues as such.There are quality schools nearby and general items are available in the society. Good hospitals are also a few kilometers away, which can be accessed by public transport. Electricity is no issue because power backup is provided and proper clean water is supplied.

There is no extra car parking charges for anyone. So, it is average only. Infrastructure is good, no issues with it. If you have your own invertors then it is fine because there is no power backup facility. Housemaids are easily available at nominal charges.

There is not much scope for expansion,like there is no option for swimming pool, badminton court etc. There is a badminton court but that is only for namesake.This is a small society where you can manage thing with your kids if your kids are 11, 12, 13 years old as living in a big society is more of hassles and you don't know where they are going. Swings and a small ground is there for kids.We have a small hall which we use for all the functions.RWA provision is there but resident or president of the society are working hard for this. Greenery is fine and it's a quiet society so you can have your peace of mind. The open area is not there because of the society area. Reserved parking is there for every apartment and if someone has more than 1,then they can park their car near the boundary of the society. There is no issues with the parking and visitor parking is also available. The infrastructure of the society is good. I like the greenery outside my balcony. There are good schools nearby within the range of 10 km. We are on Golf Course so no issues and the rapid metro is outside the society so it is a plus point. Markets are nearby at a 2 min walking distance. Good hospitals like Artemis hospital is just 5 min away. Paras hospitals are there. We have vita shops and other shops nearby where we get our daily need items easily. Otherwise, everything is very fine,the location is good,the infrastructure,security,lights and other aspects are fine too. The only thing is that we cannot expand like there is no space for a swimming pool, gym etc because of the space constraint.",

We have a basketball court, lawn tennis court, cricket and football ground facility. The green area is excellent and is well maintained too.Parking is a small problem as there is no ample parking space. There is a visitor parking which is enough for the visitors though.In terms of security the society is very good; there are good guards at the entrance and in each block. There are CCTV cameras and passes for the maids. And if any maid or a worker is carrying something out of the society they need to have a note from us.The construction quality is good and we haven\u2019t faced any problem so far.If there is any problem then the maintenance staff is very responsive. There are about 5-6 stores and a community center etc. The lifts are bigger than the normal lifts found in other societies. The power back up is just 80%. Almost all the festivals are celebrated. Safety is excellent here; the kids can be sent down to play without fear. Everything is available within the society from basic daily need items to sports facilities.",

Vehicle and visitors verification is not much efficient as there are no intercoms and sometimes they do not verify everyone and allow them in the society.Parking is good for residents as we have one indoor parking and open parking space is also there. Visitors parking are not good as it has many issues though one parking space is free for them. Streetlights are enough in number. The quality of roads is not good as it is damaged but they are doing their job well as they re make it again. In addition to this, they had installed speakers all over. Seepage is not very much. The electricity backup is 80% so it is fine. House cleaners are easily available. This place is friendly for senior citizens.",

Parking is pretty convenient here as you can pay and get as many parking spaces you want and in each block there\u2019s at least a parking space of 5 cars available for visitors. Next to Sispal there\u2019re a lot of markets and malls like:- Banni Square, Good Earth and Omaxe Nile which are very conveniently located and within a proximity of 5kms there are a lot of schools like DPS, Amity and Manav Rachna. The place is not suitable for bachelors as it\u2019s an army society so families are only allowed to buy or rent house here. Overall this is a convenient place to live in.As its an Army society the security is very good and effective. The guards here are available 24x7, and proper security has been set up for the guests as well, proper authentic security checking is conducted while entering the society and now the management will be coming up soon with intercom facility as well.  The amenities available in this society are pretty cool as we have a clubhouse, a recreational room with a lot of sports facilities and proper trainers have been provided for each sport and activity, 24x7 water and a gas pipeline connection is also given. There\u2019s an adequate amount of green parks and open spaces here, there are around 5 parks here, wherein there\u2019s a separate parks for kids and pets as well.",

The plaster done on the walls is peeling away, especially in the corners. The blocks/towers are built in a cluster but we have a common park for all the towers. Although security is great, in fact this is the best as compared to other societies, but being a tenant I would say that its good for me to stay here because I feel safe as mainly army people reside here like commanders, seniors etc. We also have guards with proper register pen-down which is good with respect to security. As an owner I would never buy an apartment in Sispal Vihar but yes as a tenant I can live here.",

Amenities are fine here as there\u2019s a tennis court where we have to pay in order to use it. Apart from this, there\u2019s a swimming pool, squash court etc. The infrastructure is very good here as the roads are fine,plus there is no seepage and no pollution. The rooms are in fact very spacious but the quality of lifts is bad as they are too slow and old now which needs maintenance. Since it\u2019s an army society  they only give the flats to family people and not to bachelors and the RWA here is not that effective as they create fuss for everything and charge unnecessary maintenance charges.",

They are hardly of any use and is on a paid basis and not used by anyone that much. Kids play area is just ok. Swings and slides are there but the society is kids friendly type.

You have amenities like clubhouse, swimming pool, gym and fitness club which are well maintained. All sports facilities are available here and there are various trainers for each sport, my son enjoy using the swimming pool facility here and my husband uses the fitness club regularly here. There\u2019s separate parlour for both gents and ladies. The security is really good here the place is quite secured and even for the kids as well. The community has gated security and there are also guards in each tower. But recently there were few incidents regarding thefts in our society so there\u2019s some gap in the security of our society and there\u2019s CCTV here but it\u2019s not functional most of the times. One of the good things about this place is that there are a lot of open areas and green parks and there are speakers installed in these parks which plays instrumental music at a low sound on every morning and evening which is really lively and amazing. There are three separate pet areas wherein it is used for dog litter and waste due to which the other areas in society remain clean. Parking is easily available here, and it depends on the owner or tenants on how much parking space he/she needs depending upon the vehicles they possess so every house at least owns 2-3 parking spaces for their cars here. Visitor parking option is available but sometimes challenges are faced for visitor parking. Another good thing about this place is the current RWA which maintains each and every infrastructure at this place really well, there were some issues and disputes faced by the tenants with the previous RWA, but the current RWA is much better. The infrastructure is pretty good here, the rooms are really spacious and not congested and my son even plays cricket in our hall room. There are also really good schools quite close around the place like: Amity International and DPS Maruti Kunj. We have got a market and a grocery store inside the society so you get all your daily items very easily. Apart from that Big Baazar and Omaxe Mall are just close by if we have to buy some high end items. Also the ladies here are of entrepreneurial spirit as most of engage in activities like: stitching and design, baking, cooking, and they advertise their products in the groups made by the ladies from the society which is quite good. There\u2019s 24x7 electricity but there\u2019s only 80% power backup available in which heavy appliances such as AC, Owen doesn\u2019t work and sometimes there\u2019s issue been faced in 2-3 flats regarding supply of water. Apart from these problems it\u2019s a well maintained society and secure place to live.",

Since it\u2019s a cooperative society its quite well maintained and since it\u2019s an army society, proper maintenance are done here on a regular basis but the layout of the apartment could have been much better. There\u2019s 24x7 electricity here but we only get 80% power backup facility. The society is really good for elderly people as there\u2019s a lot of retired army people living here.",

CCTV has fully covered the society and the society is protected.Basic facilities are lacking. DLF club is the common club for all blocks.In sports basketball, badminton court and a football ground has been provided for.Sufficient green and open spaces are available which make it a well-maintained and neat and clean society.

There is a clubhouse with a gym and a swimming pool; these are not out of the world but it is decent. There is a badminton court, squash court and a cricket field. There are lots of parks and a big well maintained field. We have enough space to park about 4 cars per apartment, so even the visitors can park their cars in this space. The infrastructure is pretty good, it is well maintained. There is Nirvana Courtyard; a big market nearby so all items needed is easily available. Events are conducted regularly too during the festivals etc.",

The parking is very convenient. This society is one of the best societies where exclusively visitor parking is available in the basement. If you have more than two cars then you have to pay 3000/m for a reserving parking for the third car. This has started from this month. Infrastructure is very good seepage is not here. Roads are good, maintained. Few things are bad here but everywhere you find it. There are school buses are allowed within the society is to pick the kids for school. The society is good but far from the main road so there is a challenge to get public transport easily. Everybodyis  having a car and UBER and Ola makes life easier. No shops are around the society. Water supply is regular but taste is ok we never use the tap water for drinking. I think all the apartment has ARO Purifier installed.

But there is a scope for improvement so we are improving, making it more kind of electronic access like biometric system etc. CCTV system is there from past two years in the society. It's fully operational everywhere in the society. It's covering the whole society though the society as in major open area but still we are managing, though. It's too good to say about this. I am seeing such society in Gurgaon where you get this kind of space around your apartment, which is great. Normally you see the buildings are here and there but the layout of the society is such that your view is uninterrupted practically. Parking is very convenient. Extra space earmarked for visitor parking in the basement. Visitor's passes are given to the visitors by the guards and they guide them to the visitor parking. So separate earmarked for visitor parking. No resident park their vehicle in dedicated parking space for visitors. Infrastructure is perfectly in place, which is needed for the good living in the society. Excellent amenities, we have the club which has gymnasium and swimming pool which is operational since the beginning and we are opening a spa, saloon and restaurant bar, steam room, 3 big multipurpose halls where you can have a party and two halls can accommodate more than 50 people and one hall can accommodate 20 people. We have a library, cards room, yoga room, zoomba classes are operational in the society. Judo classes or yoga classes are conducted within the society by the residents or by the outsiders. We celebrate festivals collectively and we organize our own society festivals on either Durga astmi or navmi like mata ki chowki etc. That is on a grand scale. That is an annual festival for our society more than 500 people participate in that and have some dinner together. I am here since 3 and 1/2 years or more than that.",

Basket ball court and badminton court is there. Only this much amenities are available here. Green and open areas are less astere is only one park at hand. Parking is fine as we have got 2 slots with our flat. I am satisfied with infrastructure as it is good and we have not faced any issues regarding seepage. Good hospitals are there but not nearby like we prefer Medanta which is 3KM far away from here. Electricity power backup is 100%. House maids availability is fine. The quality of lifts is bad as they do not work. From my view, this society is not so senior citizen friendly. We had selected this project because my daughter's school is near to this society. The main problem of this project is that the seawage plant causes bad smell which is near to this society.",

Other amenities are also lacking here because of some dispute with the builders. Open area with enough space is maintained very well. Parking is good for residents but not for visitors as parkingarea is not enough for them. There is scope for improvement in infrastructure as it is just good only not excellent.

The security is very good, initially there were some issues with the security here but soon it improved as there are guards here in this 24*7 in the society as well as in each tower, and they ensure the safety of everyone living here. We have our own gymnasium and swimming pool which are well maintained and all these facilities can be used and are operational throughout the year, the only thing we lack is here is having our own clubhouse, though there\u2019s a newly constructed clubhouse in this society but it\u2019s not yet functional so one can use it for now.  There\u2019s ample amount of green areas here which are always clean and very well maintained, but there\u2019s always a room for improvement as more green areas can be developed here as the society is in terms of area is really big. There\u2019s sufficient parking space available for the residents in the basement wherein every resident has been allotted with the parking space for 2 cars, the only issue is here for visitor parking as there\u2019s no fixed available space for visitor\u2019s parking  which needs to be improved. Apart from that rest is fine here as we get fantastic water supply and there\u2019s electricity 24*7 with good power backup and you get domestic maids easily here. I have been living here for 4yrs and I can say that this society is best which conveniently located to every place like: markets and malls, hospitals and schools. This society is an ideal place for a family.",

The amenities here are amazing as you get 24/7 electricity and regular supply of water, the swimming pool here is very good as its always clean and maintained very well. There are a lot green areas here which are very well maintained and apart from that we have also got another 20acres of separate green area here which is the best standout feature of this society. The layout of the apartment is excellent with ample parking space available for residents as well as for visitors too. The society is conveniently located to all your markets, schools and even hospitals: Medanta is just 10mins away from here. Housemaids are easily available here and you need to worry about them.

Kids play area is normal having a badminton court, basketball court, gym etc. There is enough green area in the society even backside also. We have two spots for resident parking and have open spaces for parking so is not a pain area as such. Pollution is a general problem. But no noise pollution because I stay in a tower which least away from the main road so I don't have a noise pollution as a problem. I don't know, I think a few mile differ from people who are staying closer to the main gate. Mine is the last tower from the road, so nothing in terms of noise pollution. Good hospitals are nearby   Medanta. There are some shops nearby or I go to Mill basket. Public transport is a whole Gurgaon problem there is no public transport here too. Apprtments are spacious could have done better with the design terms of increasing the room. The layout is decent I think this is a personal choice some people might like bigger drawing room or dining room I prefer bigger rooms and it's not. I have been here only for 5 months. But, in Diwali, there has been mella kind of thing which they had been put up. I don't know how good was the arrangement but something was done by RWA. Maintenance is good.",

Now the security people relate to our kids it has a personal touch to it. This is very commendable on their part. We soon to open up a beautiful club and besides having a gymnasium, swimming pool which is half Olympic size, basketball court and plus lots of greens where the children can play football, multi-type of games here. As per the clubhouse is gone a come up it has very special feature is steam bath which is like phenomenal thing. They are coming up with multiple cuisine restaurants here, spa, saloon etc. Power back is very adequate. Parking is good. In a flat of 400, we have a parking of 1000 cars parking reason being two per head or per flat and rest of them for visitors. And as per daily basic needs is a concern only you have called them they supply/deliver to your place. The clubhouse is operational within 10 days. Builder is working for hand in glove with the residents and they are agreeing too many things, which we want. The Even builder is very good even given possession after 6 years they are still ready to improve. Now Sardar Amarjeet Singh Bakshi is decided to get British Council Safety Award for the society, which is one of the best safety awards. I am here since last 7 to 8 months and I like it like anything.",

The society provides amenities such as Gym and Swimming pool which are fully operational while the season is on, as the gym is open throughout the year but the swimming pool just got shut towards the end of September because of the change in weather and these amenities are well maintained. There\u2019s also a clubhouse which just got constructed and it will be operational pretty soon. There\u2019s full of greenery here in this society which is really good. There\u2019s an underground covered basement parking and visitor parking available, every resident in this society has been allotted space to park for 2 cars but if he/she needs space to park more than 2 cars then they have to pay separate parking fee for extra space every month. Since I have been living here for one and half year, if seen that the infrastructure is quite good as it\u2019s a 7year old society the quality of these infrastructure is very good, the size of the flats are quite nice which is under 2400sqft and they are well maintained. The society is always maintained clean and the RWA takes key role in ensuring the maintenance of the society. Also you get 24x7 electricity here with regular and clean water supply. I shortlisted this place to stay in Gurgaon because it was really conveniently located as it\u2019s quite close to Subash Chowk and you won\u2019t get stuck in Sohna Road Traffic and the highways are really accessible.",

We don't change them so frequently which is a good thing. Infrastructure is designed like that all vehicle go down. So zero vehicle on the ground. We have our grocery shop for daily need items everything is nearby walking distance like more megha store, Raheja mall, theatre, hospitals, restaurants, cafe etc. Excellent apartment each apartment has light, each apartment has sunlight. I think, this is an only little society in Gurgaon, which has RCC concrete structure. There is no bricks are used. So in a way in your house inside is no pillar, because the walls are concrete. Structurally it is very good. The construction of the apartment is resistance towards earthquake situation. The clubhouse is going to be inaugurated within 15 to 20 days. We have a gym, swimming pool, the other amenities are like basketball ground, badminton ground, lawn tennis ground, and one cricket pitch is being made. There is enough green space for children to play around. Parking is exceptionally great because each owner has two parking slots. If someone has more than two cars then it's chargeable, if you have three cars then you have to pay extra every month but everybody gets parking slots because we have enough parking slots. Infrastructure is good as far as water and everything the is concern is good. This is one of the few societies in Gurgaon, which has RCC concrete structure. So, therefore, one seepage is less, second the exterior of the building is 6 years old but it is perfectly ok, practically no seepage. Normally we have RWA here who organize all these functions. Not all the festivals we celebrate only Holi, Diwali, Deshara, Janmastmi, Teej etc, so all these kinds of festivals we celebrate. We have complimentary tea services on the poolside there is a set of the area you can go there sit and have a cup of tea, cakes and biscuit on the house people came here particularly on Saturday and Sunday  morning between 6 am to 9 a.m. The builder organizes this, which is complementary from their side. They want the residents come down and interact with each other.",

We are satisfied with parking, I got 1 slot of parking which is in basement and visitor parking is also there. Infastructure is very good and we have not faced any problem related to seepage. RWA is hopeless in this soiety as they are not doing their work with full efficiency. Moreover, again and again builder is taking over this place. We easily get the house maids. Quality of lifts is good. Also, this society is senior citizen friendly as people are nice here. No proper markets are availabe in this radius only malls are there.

Construction quality is really bad and regular sewage is a problem, roads are good and smooth. Everything is nearby i.e. schools, hospitals, market.

Roads are smooth and well maintained and parking slots are available for the residents and the visitors have to park in open. Schools are in the neighborhood and a hospital is also there. Daily need items are also available in the society apart from maintenance of building everything is good here.",

There are intercoms and there are guards at the gate as well as on each tower. There are passes for the maids and there are CCTV\u2019s too but I am not sure whether they work or not. But the guard security is pretty good; anyone who walks in for example the courier guy, they call us up. There is a clubhouse with a good gym, badminton courts, squash courts, three swimming pools \u2013 2 for the toddlers and 1 for the rest. There are sports facilities like a cricket ground, football ground, basketball court. All these are being well maintained and completely functional for about a year now. We have 2 parking spaces per house, so there is no parking problem. There are designated parking spaces within the society that can be purchased. So if you have an extra car you can purchase an extra parking. Against each tower there are 5-6 visitor parking spaces provided; so there is no problem for the visitors too. The infrastructure is average because they haven\u2019t done much right now in terms of white wash or maintenance. There are bath tubs in the washrooms causing seepage but they haven\u2019t corrected this for the last 5 years, but they are doing it this year. So I won\u2019t say that they are very proactive; apart from this everything else is fine. There is a gate to Lotus Valley School through the society which opens only once in a day so it is convenient but at the same time not a nuisance. There are 2-3 shops inside with basic items and Nirvana Courtyard is also close by so it is conveniently located. There is 100% power backup 24x7. The parking in the -2 basement is not that great. Events are conducted regularly. If there is any big cricket match etc. they are telecasted in the amphitheater. The only glitch is that the intercoms don\u2019t work at times and the -2 parking. Everything else is good. It is very well laid out with all the amenities required with excellent cross ventilation of air due to the layout of the society. Everyone is happy here and the flats for rent here are immediately rented without any delay. Everything is good.",

We have a jogging and walking track of an area around 1km and a lot of green area and there\u2019s around 70% greenery inside the society. The security over here is very efficient as there are trained guards 24x7, and without any proper check no one are allowed to enter inside the society and if any housemaids leave the society carrying an baggage they are also been carefully checked and after confirmation from the resident then only they are allowed to leave. The infrastructure is decently good but it\u2019s not properly maintained these days. Parking is very convenient here as there are 2 levels of basement parking and its eve convenient for the visitors as well to park their vehicles.  Close to our society there are many play-schools and several schools and around 3-4 marketplaces in a proximity of 1km. The society is quite a big society which has got 100%powerback plus gas back up is also available as well. Maintenance cost is around 6000rs but the price is quite justified to the facilities that are been provided to us. There\u2019s too much greenery here and they are maintained really well.",

There is a squash court, a badminton court, table tennis tables and a swimming pool in the clubhouse. And there is a basketball court, lawn tennis court, skating rink and a cricket and football field. There are 3 parks good parks with very good landscaping. In terms of security there are no CCTV cameras etc. but there are good guards and intercoms. There are passes given to the maids after their police verification without which they are not allowed to enter the society. Each resident is provided with 2 allotted parking spaces; one in each basements and there is a separate space within the society where the visitors can park their vehicles. The exterior of the society is not that good it needs refurbishing. The apartment layout is very good. I have been living here for the past 6 months and there I haven\u2019t faced any problem related to electricity or water supply so far and we even have 100% power backup. There are around 2 in house general stores where you can get daily need items. Events are conducted regularly and all festivals are celebrated. There are tuition classes within the society and there are free yoga classes, karate classes and public speaking classes for the kids. This is a very big advantage that we have because we don\u2019t have to send our kids out of the society for these activities. It is a very senior citizen friendly society.",

There are several amenities that you can get here like all the sports facilities, clubhouse, gym and swimming pool but these both are not that great, but we have a J-Mart and a private shop wherein we can get all our groceries from and also there\u2019s a vegetable vendor every morning inside the society selling fresh vegetables. Security is pretty good here as there are guards and it\u2019s a gated community so proper authentic checking is done, but few incidents have been reported here lately. Parking was convenient earlier but now it\u2019s a bit strict regarding residential parking and the visitors have to park their cars outside the society. Though the layout of the infrastructure is pretty nice here but seepage issue has been a major problem faced here. There are several schools here and just behind our society we have Lotus Valley School and other schools like DPS, St.Xaviers and Heritage are quite nearby. There are many markets across the close north like Nirvana Courtyard and South City-2 and you\u2019ll get a good number of doctors running clinics in South City-2 market. Overall it\u2019s a pretty convenient and a great place to live.",

The activities or get together festivals celebrations are held there by RWA or the residents. There are lots of greenery or open spaces. And there is no restriction for children.Security of the society is very good; nobody can enter into the society without permission.Guards will not send anyone at my place without permission. Parameters of the security are very nice.  Parking is very good as there are three levels of underground parking available.For visitors, there is enough parking, which is outside the basement. Everything is very good except the seepage problem.",

It looks good from outside but lots of houses do not get sunlight all year, so that\u2019s a problem. There is a chemist, tailor, a grocery store within the society.The security here is very good; there are pretty good guards in each tower and also in the basement. There are CCTV cameras installed and there are intercoms too. Passes are given to the maids and other workers without which they are not allowed to enter the society. RFID tags are given to the residents to raise the boom barriers themselves. The clubhouse is not that large but it is pretty sufficient for the residents. The kids play area is not that bad too. There are 2 big parks; they are very well maintained and there is Ryder\u2019s academy just outside the society so kids can go there too for sports coaching etc. The parking facility is excellent; they have provided us with 2 parking spaces per apartment. Purchasing an extra parking space is discouraged here and there are parking spaces for the visitors within the society..",

Green and open areas are up to the mark. Gardeners are appointed to look after the greenery of society. Children are not allowed to play outside. Parking is excellent. We have two slots so there are no issues about parking space. At times, security has to perform a checkup but people do not have patience. Visitors are satisfied with it too. Infrastructure is very good as everything is standardized. Electricity backup is good, within 10 seconds of a power failure the power comes back on. House cleaners are easily available and their charges lie between Rs 2500-3000 in which every household chore is included except washing of clothes. Maintenance of lifts is good. This place is friendly for senior citizens.Security is very good as the vehicle and maid verification process is efficient. Maids are verified by the police and they should have valid IDs to enter the society. CCTV is installed in every tower, at main gates and in lifts. Guards are appointed at every tower and at main gate too. I had selected this project because of clubhouse as there is no queue to play any games, steam and sauna, gym and swimming pool, theatre. In addition, apartment is airy and well lit. All I can say is that the place is good to live.",

Two parking lots are provided for the residents and open parking for the visitors. I have never seen a greener and cleaner society than this one.

However, swimming pool is not operational till yet. There are ample of green and open areas here and that is an excellent thing about this place. We have two slots of parking so no issues over it, and visitors can park their respective vehicles near the tower,though parking will become an issue when the number of cars increase.There are no extra car parking charges.Infrastructure is good as a number of streetlights are present and the quality of roads is excellent too. Earlier there was an issue with the seepage in a few flats as the quality of the construction material is too bad but now it has improved a bit. The layout of the apartment is very good and it is one of the best things about this society.There is 100% backup of electricity.House cleaners are easily available here and their charges are nominal as well. The quality of lifts is good but there is no proper maintenance of it. I must say that this place is senior citizen friendly as in the evenings we play rummy and go for a walk. RWA is supportive and efficient. I selected this place, as this is Nirvana's first project which is 100% power backup and with gated security,and secondly, people here are educated and well behaved.",

The walls keep on breaking, wire fitting is not good, and they are in bad condition. Housemaids are available in the society but they don't give guarantee regarding the number of days they are going to work,and if someone offers them more money then they leave our work and start in some other house.There is water logging in the parking area because of which it has become a breeding place for mosquitoes due to which anyone can get infected and can fall ill.

DLF doesn't provide as much space as this.If I have more than two cars then I have to pay 2000 bucks and get additional parking, which is good. There are no issues with that.

The parking area is clean, even the basement parking area gets cleaned on a regular basis. Dusting is also done on regular basis.Till date i have not found any problem here. Its slightly expensive I can say, but in totality as I have seen, if there are faults/issues they are addressed without any delay. The maintenance work within the society is great. There are 3 lifts in total, in my tower there are 2 resident lifts and 1 service lift but I haven't seen it dirty anytime. \"EXCELLENT\".",

Enough and more ear marked parking spaces for the residents and there are separate visitor parking on the ground level next to the towers.The security is excellent; there are guards everywhere and they are very proactive. We have intercoms and access cards for the residents to enter the tower from the basement. The visitors are also given tags to place on the dashboard of their cars. The residents have electronic tags to open the boom barriers etc. The construction quality is very bad and horrid. There should be more maintenance done outside; there are termites everywhere. There are seepage issues in almost all the flats. There are in house fruits and grocery stores which is convenient. We also have 100% power backup. I chose this society basically because it is a part of Nirvana Country; it is a good feeling when you enter Nirvana Country. It is a good township and everything is available here expect for a multiplex, so this is a great place. Everything is good here except for the construction quality.",

Patches are visible in the building. The clubhouse is good but swimming pool is just in front of a general store hence no privacy for the swimmers ,especially ladies. It's not clean or hygienic. But the store is very good and has all the necessities which are required for everyday use. Safety wise guards are present on the gates all the time,and even in front of each tower which is actually good.The residents are good, friendly and extremely rich. Also,one cannot move out unless you have your private car as there is no public transport around. Sometimes I have even faced problem to get a cab as well. Society is very green. If there is any electricity or water (plumber) related concern, it is not solved by the maintenance here and the money goes from our pocket.",

Infrastructure wise it's not that good. The construction is very old with lots of seepage problem in bathroom and kitchen etc and we end up calling the plumber and getting it repaired.

There is no get-together organized for elders. There is sufficient open area within the society, there is cleanliness in the society which is very good.

The security here is superb as there are guards aorund 24x7 and it\u2019s a gated community with two-tier security which makes the society very safe and secured. The parks and lawns are quite sufficient according to the standards of the society, separate area is there for the pets and for their hygiene. Parking is pretty good here and no such problem is faced regarding parking even if residents own 2-3 cars. The infrastructure is just average as it\u2019s a very old society so nowadays its getting difficult in terms of maintenance but the layout is not that bad and its effective with 24x7 water and electricity supply with 100% power backup.",

We selected this place as it is near to my office and my kid's school. Other reason is that we feel safe here. Security is good as verification has happened but very rarely. Cameras might be working,no surety of that. Maids are verified before they entering in to the society. Guards are at every tower and main gate doing their part efficiently.Clubhouse and kids play are there. In sports, badminton and basketball courts are available. In addition, skating is there. Green and open areas are very good as two parks are there. For residents parking, one slot is given to each flat. Rental parking is also available. Visitors are also satisfied. Streetlights and roads are in good condition. Nowadays we are facing seepage as they had come and corrected it but not efficiently. House cleaners are easily available and quality of lifts is good but mostly one is open another is stopped. This place is friendly for seniors.",

We have a club adjacent to our society but we do not have a club.In this society,DLF Phase V,we have all the sports facilities like cricket pitch, basketball, volleyball, small football ground and small kids play area in the society. Greenery and open spaces are very good within the society and very well maintained as compared to all the society of DLF and Unitech too much of greenery and cleanliness are available. Reserve parking for resident and separate parking for visitors ensure that we do not face any problem in parking. There is somewhat of construction currently taking place. It will take sometimes to reach to very good level though. We do have an in-house shop in the society. The society is senior citizen friendly and we have one card room over here where the seniors can play.We have the main park here, where elderly people used to sit down,now there is an area where they can sit in winter's and in the rainy season. I think other than anything the guards are very good when an elder person coming outside the tower he accompanies that person to the main road and to their passage. The DLF, as I would say,is one of the best areas that I have found for the betterment and to some extent, it is developed compared to other societies with pretty good security.",

Apart from that there are trainers provided within the society for music, dance and sports as well. There are a lot of parks here with sufficient amount of greenery which is maintained very well. There\u2019s one common club here for which a membership fee has to be paid to use it. The infrastructure is great so is the parking, just recently the roads were re-constructed; the maintenance done here is as good, the buildings are quite old but the maintenance staffs are always regular and responsive and keep it well.  The parking is fairly good as every flat has been allotted with one or two parking spaces and visitors parking has been allotted by the guards and the guards here in this society are very good. They take the security matter very seriously here and conduct proper verification checks and keep an account of all the in and out visitor entries and they don\u2019t allow any stranger to enter after 8pm. The place is located in prime location where you have schools like Shallom Hills and Paras Hospital nearby. All the basic items are easily available as we have an in-house grocery store and South Point mall is close by as well. This society has got variety of different age-groups, and this place is really good for Senior citizens as well as they are provided with proper facilities and you can see them enjoying.

There\u2019s a clubhouse here in this locality which is common for 3-4 societies in this locality and you have to pay a membership fee to use it. The parking is quite convenient here for both for the visitors and residents and extra amount has to be paid if the residents need more than one parking space. Apart from that there are a lot of good schools like DPS, Shiv Nadar and Manav Rachna and hospitals like Paras which is closeby. Public transport is easily available outside the society and it\u2019s very reliable. Housemaids are easily available but they are expensive.

As the society is 15yrs old proper measures are taken for its maintenance and just recently the new roads were laid in the society. Other infrastructures like the lifts are good and so are the street lights. But the layout is not that good and so are the rooms which are not that spacious. But in terms of security and amenities it\u2019s an ideal place to live as the security is pretty good here with adequate guards in this society when compared with the rest of the societies in this locality. Intercoms and CCTV are there so does fire safety and sprinklers are there in each flat. There are a lot parks and open areas here. The senior citizens organise events for gents and ladies and they organise special pandhals and poojas during the Navratri season in the parks. Also we have different coaches for various sports facilities like cricket, karate and skating. Parking is much disciplined here and it\u2019s very convenient for both the residents and visitors. House maids are very easily available here, and also we regular electricity and water with 100% power backup. Within the vicinity of 4-5kms there are a lot good schools and hospitals. There aren\u2019t any markets nearby apart from South Point mall but we have a Safal store, milkman and vegetable store from where we get all our daily items very easily. The society is a happening place and there\u2019s a lot of different age group of people living here and each group is very lively and friendly.",

They have made the badminton court, volleyball court, cricket pitch, football ground; skating etc. but not maintained them, swings and slides are available in the park. Security within the society is not good because anybody can enter but the guards hardly check them due to which one case happened before. They do not do the proper verification.Even though CCTVs are installed here but I do not know if anybody is there to check or monitor that or not. Maintenance of the society is average. There is green and open areas which is quite good. The walking area is a lot, area wise it is good. Greenery should be more. One poop area is there for pets. In parking, there is no problem it is ok. For resident's one parking slot and for the visitor, separate parking is there but it is very far from our flat we have to walk a bit of a distance. Earlier roads were not good but RWA has taken initiative so now roads are good. Infrastructure is not up to the mark. This is an average locality with no gym, also you have to walk to the club area i.e. DLF club and you have to become a member to utilize the club facilities and you to have to pay for that. Schools are there nearby but they are not that good. Markets are nearby. Paras hospital is also nearby.Outside the gate, we get private autos easily. The apartment is not spacious I find it like a cage, small balcony and all. Regular water is there but do not know it is clean or not. The quality of lifts is not very good time to time, we have to remind and maintenance people do come and repair it. The security is very bad. The society is senior citizen friendly.",

The amenities that we get here are very good, we have a proper vegetable shop, parlour, chemists within premises and we have proper trainers and coaches for sports like: Karate, Skating and Cricket. We have a common club here but we need to pay a membership in order to use the club apart from that there\u2019s regular supply of water 24x7 electricity with 100% power backup. There\u2019s sufficient amount of greenery and open areas here, which are pretty well maintained and there\u2019s a separate area for pets as well. The infrastructure is amazingly good as the layout is pretty efficient and nice and the construction quality of the buildings is so good.Since its 15yr old so the management takes a keen effort in its maintenance and recently they just laid the roads within the society. The security here is efficient as guards are everywhere and are always very cautious and alert. There\u2019s intercom and CCTV here and guards call up just to verify through the intercom if someone comes from outside to visit us. Parking is very nice here as every resident has got designated parking and for visitors, parking is taken care off by the guards. The society is really good for senior citizens and the engagement from the people is very lively and high when festive and other events are organized. There are good schools within 3-4kms and good hospitals as well and some of the residents are doctors so we can visit them at their home. Above all this is one of the best places to live in phase 5.",

Proper authentic security checks are taken by the security personals. There\u2019s even CCTV and intercom facility here as well and for the past 4yrs I haven\u2019t heard any incident regarding theft here. The infrastructure is just average here since the society is 15yrs olds now , we often have plumbing issues and the layout is not that good as the flooring has been badly done and the space has been not utilised pretty well due to which the rooms' size varies. The roads are good as they recently laid up the roads within the society and lifts are serviced from time to time. There\u2019s 24x7 electricity with 100% power backup and  regular supply of water.  There\u2019s a library which just got opened and its good for both kids and senior citizens and there are a lot of sports facilities also provided for the kids with proper trainers as well and within the society the people take up music, art and dance classes as well so all recreational activities are easily available. Apart from that there\u2019s a Pharmacy, grocery store inside the society wherein we get all our daily items or else Vyaapar Kendra market is just a drive away. We have nice lawns and parks here which are maintained very well on a regular basis. Parking is very convenient here as every house has got 1 space allotted for parking and they need to pay extra if they need another parking space and there\u2019s ample parking space for visitors as well and the space for them is allotted by the security guards. Apart from that there are a few good schools close by and hospitals like Max, Fortis and Medanta are there within the radius of 3-4 kms. Overall it\u2019s a great society because of its prime location and with the amount of facilities available here.",

There are 2 slots allotted to each person and if a person has more than 2 cars the parking is paid.Visitor parking is congested. Greenery is good and there is ample space for it,also,it is very well maintained as well. Pets are not allowed in the parks. There is a proper pet area for them. No personal clubhouse. There are events organized on diwali & Christmas. Kids playing area is sufficient. There is a basketball court, Badminton court, Football ground but no proper skating area. Security is good. CCTV are installed. New cameras have been installed inside the lifts and main gates. Verification is done for the strangers entering into the society,guards are ethical as well.As Nimbus security is incharge,we feel safe. Maids are available easily and are not expensive. Our tower lift is bad most of the times, only one lift works. Other tower lifts are good. Yes it is senior citizen friendly but not bachelor friendly.",

Guards are at lobby area both the times and 24 hours at main gate. They take 4 to 5 times rounds in all over society. There is no clubhouse but, kids play area is available but no carpets for kid's safety. Now, they have started the sports facility. Green and open areas are good and well-maintained. Parking is good for residents but they do not have space for visitor's parking. Infrastructure is fine as no streetlights are present and roads are ok only. There is no seepage issue. House cleaners are easily available.The quality of lifts is too poor as they are too old and some problems in lifts. This place is not friendly for seniors.",

The society has double-security which is better than other societies, there are intercoms and CCTV installed everywhere and proper surveillance is done by the guards here. There\u2019s a common clubhouse which has a banquet hall and in this society we have various sports facilities, the management organises various competitions and the maintenance is very good since it\u2019s an old society as everything here like buildings, roads and the lifts are properly managed and maintained. Parking is fine and nice and every house has been assigned 1-2 parking spaces and there\u2019s ample space available for visitor\u2019s which is quite enough. We have around 3-4 parks here wherein kids are also allowed to play. The senior citizens are very friendly and social here and they take keen interest in organising a lot of events in the society. The layout is decent since every DLF property in this locality has got the same layout but the flooring is a bit small. There are good schools, hospitals like Paras and Suncity market within 5kms of radius but we have got a lot of convenience stores, chemist and saloon inside the society which is quite convenient for us as we get all our daily items very easily and it\u2019s very reliable. Overall this place is best place for a family to live in as all your basic amenities are provided with great security.",

The disadvantage with this it that if a resident is unlocking this biometric lock, those people who don\u2019t have access also enters along with them. There are guards who do roam around to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen but it still happens. This society is not that pet friendly because there are no separate pooping areas for them or areas where they can roam around easily. We had a pet dog but had to give him away because of this inconvenience. There is no separate ground for kids to play cricket or football, moreover they have put a notice that says kids are not allowed to play in the parks, but there must be separate ground for them.",

But recently security has been a major issue, we have security guards but there are very less CCTVs. The thing I dislike about this society is that the project falls on the main road so even to get out of the society is very difficult because of the traffic jams and narrow service lanes. Maintenance is perfect, greenery wise it is the best society on Sohna road. Club house is not up to the mark, they definitely need some improvements. We need a football ground and some designated area to play cricket. Services are perfect in the community and the lifts are in a good condition. Traffic jam is the major issue and I feel it is not conveniently located because of the main road right in the front.",

I like the layout of the apartment very much, not an inch is wasted. The rooms are very well lit and well ventilated. The maintenance of the building and the surrounding open areas is very good. There are three swimming pools and a clubhouse with badminton courts, gym etc. which are very well maintained. Every festival is celebrated here and the arrangements for these are good but sometimes it\u2019s a nuisance. There is a designated area for toddlers but its very small. There are good parks where the kids can play football or cricket or anything they like. Water-logging is experienced during monsoon but it drains out very quickly. Facility office is always on their toes to keep the society clean. Living as a tenant has much more advantage than living as an owner here. Towers and the parking area is not that well connected and in-house plumbing or electricity issues have to be taken care of by residents itself. As far as cleanliness and hygiene is concerned, the RWA is doing a good job. But security is a bit poor as there is only one guard for three towers. Biometric and door-lock is available which can only be unlocked by the residents.I have been living in this society for 9 years now and I can say that this is one of the best properties on Sohna Road.

The kids can play around in the park but there are some restrictions on the games that can be played in the park. Each apartment has 2 allotted parking spaces but if you have an extra car you can very well purchase an extra car parking. There is a separate parking space provided for the visitors. The infrastructure is also pretty good. The exterior could have been better but the interior is very good. In terms of security, it is very good; there are good guards 24x7. All the towers have intercoms and biometric locks. And there are passes for the maids too without which they cannot enter the society. The lifts are good; we haven\u2019t faced any problem with them. We have a pretty good clubhouse. There is a gym, a badminton court, a good swimming pool, table tennis tables in the clubhouse. And there is steam and sauna room too in the clubhouse but it doesn\u2019t work. The kids play area is just ok; it is not that well maintained. There is lawn tennis court too just beside the clubhouse. The society as a whole is very senior citizen friendly.",

Construction quality is not that good as seepage is the major issue here. They charge us quite a high amount for maintenance. Almost all the festivals are celebrated very well including Holi and Diwali. I feel that the parks are good for the children as the guards also take care of my grandchildren, they are fully secured here. When we were at Delhi we changed almost 10 flats there, but since we started living here we haven't looked for any other society, we are happy with this place.

Parking is very convenient for residents and visitors and there\u2019s no such problems faced in for parking here. The quality of the infrastructure is superb as the rooms are spacious.

Noise pollution is a concern as the society stands right next to the main road and honking cars and traffic irritates people. The society is very hygienic as the maintenance is good.

The lobby should be made better. Steam and sauna should be started as there are provisions provided in the club.",

The flats are quite big and spacious and the flooring in the flats is also good. Security is just average. The corridors are pretty nice, but there are mud spots in some areas because of the plant pots or the cycles that are kept in the corridors,they look really bad. The drainage system is very bad; it becomes a mess during rainy seasons. There is a beer factory next to the society; this causes major problem especially in summers when wine is being manufactured. Drivers park their cars anywhere they want and it creates a chaos.",

You can keep your door open even then there will be no security problems. Swimming pools are not hygienic and not well maintained. There are so many restrictions for the kids,there is a need to make this place better where all kids can play. The cricket nets are also not that good as there is not much space. They charge a handsome money for maintenance, but there is no utilization of money.Events are held but they are not that good. Basic needs like grocery stores are there but other basic facilities like medical facility, parlor or salons are not within the society and we have to go outside for everything. If there is an emergency during non working time then no one knows where to go. Doctors are not allowed to advertise or open clinics. Neither dancing schools nor painting classes are available within the society. There are people who are interested to start these within the society but they charge around Rs. 8000 within the clubhouse and even if I wish to start something, I am not able to do it. It is better if these facilities are there within the society. Security as well as convenience is good though. You can drop your children off to classes easily or they can go themselves if it is within the society.My question to the management is that if there are doctors or music teachers within Nile then why aren\u2019t they allowed to work within the society? I understand that they do not want to commercialize the society for security reasons but how is the security sacrificed if these services are provided only for the residents for Nile and no one from outside? Many people are working and they want to put their children for activity classes so it would be better if these facilities happen within the society. Another issue is with the parking which is a hell of a problem. There are many empty parking slots but they do not provide extra car parking. Many people own more than one car nowadays and this causes a lot of problem. Many people are facing this problem but the office members do not help us out in any parking issues. In addition, visitor car parking is available just for two hours so even the guests feel uncomfortable. Another problem is the rash driving within the society,for this there should be some kind of a speed limit for safety. Maintenance in vacant flats is not good which causes seepage problems. There is no separate schedule for male and female in the gym and gym closes too early. Many women finish with their work around 11am but the gym is closed at this time,also there should be both male and female instructors in the gym,for these reasons I have joined the gym outside the society. There should be separate timings for men and women for using the swimming pool too.For more improvement compulsory meetings should be conducted for tenants and owners to discuss problems and come up with a solution.",

We have many apartments that are very spacious. The place is quite airy,the skyline is visible while in most of the societies, it is not visible due to the high-rise towers. This project is less crowded. We have huge Jacuzzi in bathrooms. Bedrooms are very good with attached dressing rooms .The houses are made very nicely and not even an inch of space is wasted. Earlier I used to change houses very frequently but now I am here for one year because of the layout of the apartment. The layout of the society is a bit irregular and congested, they have just accommodated things here, central park children's play area and swimming pool is very small.But the people are very warm and there is no animosity among the residents. It is a very secure space,and when I go out I do not have to worry about my family, we are in safe hands.The security is doing a very good job.Temple is there on both the sides of the society and the approach to the road is very bad.",

There is lots of greenery in the society with a lot of trees in and outside the society. There is a factory that is located next to the society but it does not cause any such nuisance.

The rooms are pretty good and the infrastructure is satisfactory. The lifts don\u2019t work at times; this can be taken care of. The central park is good enough. The parking is in the basement and they have just provided one car-parking slot for each apartment. This project is not conveniently located as cab drivers do not understand how to arrive or locate this society and it\u2019s pretty difficult to find public transport.

Rooms are no doubt very spacious. Kids play area is OK. The speed breakers within the society are very abrupt. The parks are very well maintained but kids don\u2019t find any use of the parks but it\u2019s really good for senior citizens for a nice walk or an evening chat.

Guards are given strict instructions that any kid up to the age of 8 is to be allowed to go outside only with their parents or their guardian. The clubhouse is very neat and tidy and well maintained. The maintenance charges are also less compared to other societies on Sohna Road. Parking crisis is always there, every flat gets one car-parking but if any resident has two cars they can park their other car in the extra car-parking zone provided outside. Builder has not given even 1 inch extra for parking (just the norms are followed). The size of the society is very small compared to the population of the society. There are a total of 9 towers, 8 towers inside and 1 tower is outside but they have the same layout.",

Overall it has a very safe and clean environment. The clubhouse amenities and facilities are very good, but they don't provide catering. Lawns and separate courts for each sport are well maintained and so is the kids play area. In-house store is more or less sufficient. We have enough basement parking. All the festivals are celebrated in the central park by putting up posters and notices prior to the date of the festival so that the residents are aware of the event.",

The existence of the beer factory is a problem because of the pollution factor. The community is closely bound and there is a lot of harmony among the people. Temple is there on both the sides of the society. All day-to-day needs are fulfilled easily here. There is also a Rider sports academy near, at Uppal southend. All school buses come here at the door of the society. There is a parking issue, only one parking has been provided and paid parking is outside the society. They charge up to 700-800 bucks. Since its 7-8 years old society, so the exterior lacks glamour which can be improved. Its first and flagship society of Omaxe. However, it is easy for the pocket. Seepage issue is there in the ground as the builder did not use good pipeline but that can be improved. The society is located at a distance from the main road so not that much approachable.",

Electricity is there for 24*7 as they have a good backup and if the electricity goes, it comes within 2 or 3 minutes. Therefore, it is not a big issue. I can only say the availability of the housemaids is not perfect,as the maids are highly priced but yes, we finally got one maid after the struggle of one week. Parks are very good. The parking is not so excellent but it is very good. The layout of the apartment is average because the seepage problem is there which has not been corrected till yet. We have already spoken to the RWA members 15 days back but they have hardly responded to it, even though they respond immediately otherwise. Infrastructure is fine. There are no good markets, like stationery or Xerox shops. As my child goes to school and they are frequently in need of stationery items,that becomes a problem.",

There is no problem with drainage system but there was one episode of heavy rains and water logging. But yes, Sohna road traffic is always a problem. Few things that could be improved in this society are the shops like mother dairy and vegetable vendors. The project is conveniently located like there are two malls, one temple and others things which are located nearby. The apartments are  facing Sohna road. My kid is too small to go to school. Therefore, I have no idea about the good schools over here. There is Medanta Hospital nearby but we do not go there. We used go to Fortis which is 20 minutes away from here.",

According to season, plants or trees are changed, so there is a lot of greenery all year round. 24 hours power backup & water supply is available.It is available all the time. We easily get housemaids and sometime guards also help the residents to find one. Everyone  is having their own reserve parking, where they park their car. Visitor parking is also available.

The RWA functions well though and they organize good events.The security is good; there are guards 24x7 in all the towers and even in the parking areas. There are CCTV cameras and passes for the maids as well. There are intercoms so they call us every time we have a guest. There is a clubhouse which is just ok.We have a swimming pool but it hasnt been functional since the 1st of October. We have a badminton court, snooker table and a lawn tennis court. We also have a kids play area which is just average. There are about 8-10 good parks within the society and they are well maintained too. The parking facility is very poor; they have provided just one parking for a person living in a 4BHK and if you have an extra car you can purchase an extra parking. There is no parking space allotted for the visitors, they have to park their cars outside.",

Elders should get some kind of facility for public transport. There should be a market within the society so that the local residents can avail the facilities. It will also assure supply of essential commodities at reasonable rates. Also we have no medical stores within the society because of which we have to travel till Fazilpur to even take a tablet. Neat and clean parks are there within the society. Security is really good and is well structured, cultured and respectful. Maintenance of club is good but there is a need of a well stocked library which should have many books. There should be a letter box in every single tower. There is a laughter session in the morning hours i.e. 5:30-6:00 AM. There is a provision for elderly people to play cards, etc also,yoga is performed in the morning.",

Cameras are installed at each and  every tower. Maids are also verified twice before entering in to the society and guards are also allocated everywhere. Swimming pool is properly cleaned and is hygenic.Clubhouse and kids play area is available. We have a Tennis and badminton court in sports facility.Parks are well-maintained as every five towers are surrounded by a garden area which is quite green and playing outdoor games are allowed to children. Parking is fine as we have slot of parking and another vehicle can park outside. Visitors have to walk a lot because they cannot park inside the society and only outside space is available for them. Infrastructure is good as roads are good inside the project but not outside .This area is well lighted because of enough number of streetlights within the project. There is a little bit seepage issue. House cleaners are easily available but rates are not reasonable. The quality of lifts is nice. This place is not friendly for senior citizens as there are no ramps. There are no such good hospitals available nearby and we have to go 6 KMS for medical facility.",

The design,the layout and the infrastructure here is superb and efficient.The security here uses the latest security technologies which makes the place really safe and secure. The clubhouse offered to us in this society is by far the best clubhouse in all over Gurgaon. We have a got a good swimming pool and all sports facilities like: - Badminton, Tennis and Basketball courts here.There are a lot of green parks and open areas wherein the kids are allowed to play which is quite sufficient according to the size standards of the society. Parking is very convenient here as all the residents get 2 car parking space and 1 car park space is given for visitors. There\u2019s an in-house grocery store also available for us from where we get all our daily basic items very easily which makes it quite convenient for us. The people living in this society are very friendly and social and gather and engage a lot during community events. Overall I can say that this is one of the best societies to live with great facilities.",

Parking is excellent as everybody gets two parking slots,they can also ask for extra parking on rent.There are three levels of parking which you can find when you enter the gate.There is a slope leading towrads the basement parking.For the visitor, there is enough space for parking.There is a slip for the visitor parking and it is compulsory that the residents whom they come to meet should sign the slip.

Parking is available for the residents but if the owner has more than 2 cars then parking becomes a problem.For visitors there\u2019s one parking lot space available, but in case of a party here then we have to inform the guards about it who arrange for more parking facility.The construction quality is just average here and we often face seepage issues, maintenance staff like the plumber needs to be more  efficient.The houses here lack privacy as you can see what\u2019s happening in the other house through the window but apart from that the layout is efficient in a 1000sqft yard.There is ample spacious rooms here and we have a pretty good lawn too,as I love pets we have 3 pets here and this place is quite pet friendly.Since it\u2019s a well gated community and the security is also pretty efficient and effective here, we don\u2019t need to close the doors of our house as it\u2019s safe and secure living here.CCTV cameras are always operational and guards are always present.The area is conveniently located near various malls and hospitals and maids are very easily available here.The society is pretty quiet and peaceful.The community living is great here as I can see people engaging in a lot of various activities.",

Members of the society have the strickers of the association on their vehicle. So everything is in proper control. Greenery is bit less and wherever it is. People don't respect it. They throw litter every where  though the society has provided dustbins. But greenery should be more in the society. Electricity is absolutely excellent. We don't even realize that there 's a cut in gurgaon. Even the light goes they start bckup in a blink and no shortage of water also. Enough parking lotted to each apartment. We never got or found any trouble. That's different if you have 4-5 cars. Away from noise pollution and air pollution, traffic but i guess they should actually concentrate on the main roads entry side and the back side. If they have provided everything so perfect them why not. Huge spacious. Accurately built as per do a human's comfort looks beautiful and it is beautiful. Lifts are fast enough. Automatic saving system. Neighbours are friendly.",

They have CCTV's around but I do not know if they are working or not. They do not have any clubhouse in Tatvam.We have to give maintenance, which is very high, but it is mostly for gardener or security. They do not have any specific reason for that. There is a kids play area, which is good, and the sports facilities where we have a cricket pitch where we have tennis, basketball, badminton courts. Definitely, there is lots of greenery and open spaces which are very well maintained regularly but what they do is that they encourage the owner to pick up the poop and all that. The owner has to take them outside the society. The residents have two reserve parking but if you have more than two cars then you have to park in the visitors parking which is dedicated for visitors who always face a problem. Infrastructure is bad as we are facing seepage problem,the walls are moist during winter, and water palms break down. Water is regular but not clean because sometimes we see white stuff in the water like chlorine and you cannot drink directly from the tap. You have to install RO for that.The senior citizen has a day, which is senior citizen day in a year that is all, which they have.",

Clubhouse is under construction apart,but from that there is good space for kids to play. For sports there are badminton court, snooker and a swimming pool.Apart from unnecessary speed breakers the roads are smooth. Everything is nearby including good schools and hospitals. As I don\u2019t use public transport so I don\u2019t have much idea about its accessibility. Construction quality is good. Electricity is never an issue as proper backup is provided.

It has been only 3 months living in this society,we have a lawn here and some slides or swings for kids. There is a skating activity for kids. Greenery is good outside the society too. And houses have a ventilation system which is very good. But greenery maintenance is average, cleanliness is also not there.

The clubhouse is under construction and they are constructing some sports court next to the park.The security is very good. There is 2 tier security; one at the main entrance and second at the tower. There are good guards, CCTV cameras, intercoms and passes for the maids.The small kids can\u2019t go out of the tower without the parents giving permission to the tower guard. There is a small well maintained kid\u2019s play area in the park where small kids can play. I can\u2019t say that there are huge green areas but whatever is there, it is well maintained. We have enough parking spaces; they provide the residents with one parking space for 2BHK which is in the basement and 2 parking spaces for 3BHK where one is in the basement and the other outside on the ground level. There is no allotted parking space for the visitors; they have to park outside the society. There are no major problems related to infrastructure but the quality of work and the output, basically the finishing, is not good enough inside the apartment as well as the outside. Drill a nail and the plaster and the cement powder just falls off; seems like there is very less cement used. There are malls around but no local markets plus there are shops within the society as well as just outside. Another problem is with the balconies; we have 3 balconies, one in the drawing room, one in the bedroom and the other one is the utility balcony but they are very very small. We don\u2019t have government electricity here; it is gen sec so there is 24x7 power supply. The lifts are not maintained properly in our tower because of the ongoing construction but in those towers which are fully occupied it is well maintained. Events are conducted very well here and this is a good society for the senior citizens too.",

Parking is very convenient here,all those who live in a 3BHK apartment usually get 2 car parking spaces and the ones who live in 2bhk apartments get 1 car parking space and if they have need for more parking space then they pay a fee to get that extra space. The construction quality is not really good here and if anything gets damaged then you\u2019ll have to fix it by yourself. There aren\u2019t any markets nearby saving one in-house grocery store where you can get all your things very easily.

Vehicles are checked regularly and they make sure that residents do not park their cars in the spaces which are not allotted to them. I am totally satisfied with the parking facility; we have 2 parking spaces as we have a 3BHK but there is no allotted parking space for the visitors, they have to park outside. The infrastructure is very poor; it has just been a year and there are cracks in the walls, the cement is coming out and there are seepage issues. Even the wood work in the kitchen falls out. It is very bad.

Even the security team appointed by Unitech is also not reliable; they are not exactly doing what they have to.There are lots of lapses in security, for example,if there is a courier guy coming,they check the ID and sometimes they dont so it seems like it depends on their mood. There is no clubhouse here but there is a small kid\u2019s play area which is just ok as they are not even cleaned sometimes during the rainy season. There is just one park here which is not maintained properly as pet poops can be found here and there in the park. There are no sports facilities like a badminton court, tennis court or a badminton court. We had booked this flat 7 years back and at that time a tennis court and another green area was proposed at the back side but so far there is nothing; it is under construction I suppose. The parking facilities are ok; there are allotted parking spaces for the residents and an extra car parking can be purchased if needed but it is pretty expensive; it is about 4-5 lakhs now I guess. There are no visitor parking spaces. The overall infrastructure of the society is not that good, it is just ok. The main issue is the water seepage. It is not that it cannot be sorted out but I have no idea why these people are not taking care of that.The maintenance is not doing their job properly. We have an in house grocery store, so it is easy to get basic items. There is 100% power back up. The events are organized by the residents for all the festivals.When we took the flat here we knew that it is not a luxury apartment, it is just a basic apartment, but the location of the society is really good, all this society needs is a little grooming. \u00a0If the maintenance department does their job properly the society will be awesome.",

At the time of renting they told me that I will be provided with two parking slots but the other parking area is still under construction.Roads are in a pathetic condition. Market is nearby and hospitals are situated closely too. There are no proper shops inside the society and connectivity with transportation is also weak.

Being a small 3 tiered society it is very well maintained and quite peaceful though the amenitites are quite less. A lot of CCTV cams are there. Guards are very active and alert. Greenery is relatively sufficient I have seen other societies as well. There is ample parking space because not many people are live here. Everyone has their own paid parking. Its a DLF project so quite sorted and they maintain everything very well.",

The second best thing is the security; there are good guards but they need better training. There are no CCTV cameras installed but we do have biometrics and there are passes for the maids and workers. The point is that if the security has to be improved the cost also goes higher relatively, so it is pretty difficult to improve the security. There are good amenities here; there is a clubhouse which has yoga room, billiard table, table tennis table, squash court and a cricket pitch. There is a \u2018pool\u2019, but it is a splash pool; just for name sake and there is a fairly good gym. We have basketball court, lawn tennis court and badminton courts too. There are good parks which are well maintained and watered daily. The parking facility is pretty good; each apartment is allotted with one parking space and there are basement parking too. If you have an extra parking you can very well purchase another parking. There is adequate number of visitor parking spaces too within the society. There are 2 stores within the society so basic need items are pretty much available but it is pretty expensive compared to the markets outside, especially the vegetables. There is 100% power back up so there is no problem with electricity. One major problem is the stray dogs here in the society; they are huge trouble. Plumbers and carpenters are there to help first but they give priority to society first then to the residents so the work might not be done on time. A society\u2019s improvement depends on how the RWA runs it, but there are a lot of infights, so there is some lack of trust. There is a separate cultural committee that decides and organizes the events and they do a very good job. So all these things make the senior citizens happy.",

The security is just average as there\u2019s an intercom facility in our lobby but don\u2019t know about its availability in other towers and also we have CCTV surveillance as well.Also the security guards conduct proper security checks.  The parking is disciplined and well controlled here. Every resident has got minimum 1 parking space but if he/she needs more than one space then they can buy it on rent.There\u2019s sufficient parking space available for visitor parking as well. The infrastructure is fine as the layout of the apartments is pretty good; the lifts are operational and well maintained. The roads need to be a bit maintained and there\u2019s a separate area assigned for the pets to stroll and to remove their waste as well. The amenities provided here are very good as we have got a decent clubhouse with a gym in it apart from that we have a swimming pool, tennis courts cricket pitch and basketball courts. Various trainers have also been provided for the kids for various sports.  Also we have a grocery store, convenience store, milk booth, saloon and tailor which are pretty convenient for us. Next to our locality we have South Point mall where there are a lot of restaurants. There\u2019s 24x7electricty with 100% power backup and regular supply of water. Also maids are easily available here.There are 2 good schools next to our society namely: Suncity and Lancer. Overall this society is a very good place to live as we have a decent community living here with a lot of functions being organised by the RWA. It was worth a good investment to this place.",

Amenities are good but the clubhouse is not actually owned by the owner and as I shifted there last month,the owner told me that the rent  included the clubhouse expense too but right now for opting for the gym I have to pay 13k. Green open area is very good and well maintained. Visitor plus resident parking is good. Infrastructure is good; roads are in very bad condition and the roads towards the society are quite poor.",

The green and open area is just excellent as about 75%-80% is opening (green + concrete). There is one big park which is divided into 2 parts; one half for the kids and the other half for the senior citizens as the ball games played by the children might hurt the senior citizens. The parking facility is also excellent; each resident has 1 allotted parking and they can even purchase an extra parking if it is necessary. The visitors have parking spaces within the society itself; there are around 5 visitor parking spaces with each tower. It is a new society; it has just been 2 years so there hasn\u2019t been any issue so far. It is a new area; it has just 2-3 societies in this area. There is a grocery and a chemist stores. The 2BHK flats have a size of 1500 sqft which is typically for 3BHK. It is very luxuries. The water supply was an issue till a few months back but now it is resolved. There is a good sense of community here; there are jagraatas organized for the senior citizens, fashion show for the kids. The location of the society is bad but rest everything is great.",

There are very well maintained lush green areas with small kids play area with rides etc. for the kids. The clubhouse is excellent. It has a good gym, a very good swimming pool and yoga room. It also has a yoga room, carom boards, badminton court and table tennis tables. The security here is pretty good; there are guards but it is not very systematic. It is not very techy too; that is there is no biometric lock or CCTV camera etc. There are cards issued for the workers within the society without which they cannot enter the society, but anyone can get access to that card too. There are intercoms but they are not used always. It is a very senior citizen friendly society. They provide us with one allotted parking space and if you have an extra car you can purchase an extra parking space. There is a separate space within the society where the visitors can park their vehicles. We face a small challenge with electricity at times as there are frequent cut offs but it is not a problem because we do have 100% power backup. There are in-house stores like J-mart, a chemist shop, grocery store and a barber shop too. The quality of the roads outside the society connecting to the society and the roads connecting to Sohna road is terrible which has to be improved. But overall, the society is fantastic.",

The kids play area is kind of ok.The security is just average here as there is no proper security at the main gate. The intercoms don\u2019t work and there are no passes for the maids etc. which is there in every other society. The open and green area is the only thing that is maintained here. The landscaping of the society is really good. All the residents have allotted parking spaces in either of the two basements and it is well maintained too. The infrastructure is disastrous. There is just one carpenter for both Escape as well as Harmony, and there aren\u2019t enough support staff here. There are seepage issues. I have problem with the intercom for the last 9 months and till now it hasn\u2019t been corrected.  The quality of the lift is good but if there is any issue with the lift it takes a lot of time to be corrected. It is not at all pet friendly here. Events are conducted for all the festivals.",

Some incidents happened but we can't blame it on the RWA because it all depends on person to person. Because it is a small area, I think there should be provision for kids not to have a place for riding cycling. So that kids can't drive cycle into the toddler zone. They can drive their cycle around the society but not in the kid's zone.The society is completely guarded,and we cant keep a maid without verification which is good. At least compared to my previous society this is the best society in terms of greenery and open spaces. Parking is good because of the basement, there are no issues with the parking. Seven towers are there in the society but they are not fully occupied. Only five towers are occupied so anyone can park their car anywhere. Space is distributed but space is not a problem. Construction quality is kind of average as the seepage is the main problem. Another thing like the water supply is good. Members manage electricity by themselves. The society is kind of unfurnished with two three towers not completed. Because of this, the clubhouse is not completed and that gives a kind of unfurnished look.",

Sometimes if they are not in a mood then they don't allow anyone to enter and do whatever they want. Greenery and open spaces are there and maintenance is good but cleanliness is not up to the mark. Parking is good and that's what I love about this society,we enjoy two basement parking, for parking very few societies have this kind of facility. Seepage is too much which is the main problem. Four months I have been here,but I am still exploring options. We celebrate every festival together. It's a right kind of escape.",

I really like the parks and green areas which are constructed here and are designed in an amazing layout.They are always well maintained and the parks here are quite big wherein kids are also allowed to play. The security is pretty efficient here as there are guards around all the time and effective security checks are conducted at the gates. We have a decent clubhouse and various outdoor sports courts for basketball and badminton but no swimming pool which is a drawback. Parking is easily available here as there are 2 car parking spaces available for residents and 1 car park space for visitors. The infrastructure is just fine here since all the Unitech properties have poor construction quality so this one is just better than the rest but still we face seepage issues quite often here. There\u2019s a good community living here and everyone is very social and friendly. Maids are very easy to get as there are a lot of villages close by so it\u2019s not that hard actually to get one. Also the place is centrally located to markets, schools and hospitals which are very easily approachable.",

I had a burglary due to very poor security system so from that standpoint entries should be monitored.There is only one entry and exit point, which is very good. Despite the fact that intercom is not installed in the newer condominiums or towers,they have a pretty good system of getting by the security. I think it will be appreciable if the clubhouse could be better. We could really improve on the clubhouse.We have a gym, squash, badminton court but that can be improved. Table tennis is there. I wish there was an entertainment area in the clubhouse, which is not there. Multipurpose hall a restaurant for a food within the society or a coffee shop would be better. Kids play area is nice, only a swimming pool is not there, they are making it but they are making it from a long time now. I am satisfied with the greenery and open spaces of the society. Visitor and resident parking is decent. Infrastructure is average. There are joint festivals organized by the society members. RWA are quite active,the society is very convenient and the location is good. All the facilities are available at one place.",

The number of the house in the society is very less so in that way, there is a lot of greenery in the society. Parking is more than adequate and is in front of every block. There are issues with seepage, plumbing and in terms of overall infrastructure. Yes, there is a problem in infrastructure,I am living here in this place for 4 years, and still it is under construction. It is a convenient location with well laid out flats.

And there is good ratio of green space to the constructed space. Parking facility is also good; 2 parking spaces are allotted to the residents and if you want another parking then you will have to purchase it. There is a separate parking space for the visitors too. The infrastructure is just ok; the towers are not maintained properly. Even the new towers look like they were built years back. The quality of the lifts is good but there should be more regular maintenance and once it gets repaired, it takes a long time to get functional again.The security is just good not excellent; the guards doze off during their duty and as Unitech doesn\u2019t have any money they are not able to pay the work force hired by them due to which the security is compromised. There are CCTV\u2019s but they are faulty because they are not maintained properly. There are spaces for about 7 shops within the society but there is just one store here. It is not that pet friendly as the lawn gets dirty because of the pets etc. And we have 100% power backup.",

One of the best things that I like about this place is security, which is well- organized as vehicle and visitor verification happens with efficiency.Intercoms system is there. Cameras are installed at each tower and at the main gate even security guards are allocated at both places as well which makes the security effective. Amenities are very good as clubhouse and some sports facility are there. One shopping complex is available in our project but swimming pool is not operational. Green and open areas are well maintained and we have three parks in our society. Even the children are not allowed to play in these parks. Parking is very convenient because of enough space being available. We have our parking slot in the basement and we can park our vehicles in front of each tower. Even visitors are also satisfied with it.Infrastructure is fine as streetlights are there.The quality of roads is fine as they keep on repairing them.There is a seepage problem in every flat. The electricity backup is good. House cleaners are easily available. The quality of lifts is excellent. This place is friendly for senior citizens as walking area and greenery is available.

Parking is much disciplined here as there\u2019s ample parking space available as every house has at least 2 car parking spaces and it depends on the owner if he/she wants more parking space.There\u2019s no problem faced in visitor parking as there\u2019s sufficient parking space available for visitors as well. The infrastructure is pretty efficient with excellent layout but seepage issues are the common problem faced here. Apart from these there are many good schools close by like St. Xavier\u2019s is just a few minutes away from this society and the place is centrally located to markets like :- Arcadia and to hospitals like:- Arthemis and Cloud 9.

Security is good because the guards are good and when any item is delivered then firstly they call us, so safety is there.Only lawn area is available for the kids and no activities are there for them. The workmanship of the society is very poor. Greenery is good and walking space is there. We can breathe properly because of the greenery. Two cars parking is available in the basement, visitors can park their car on the ground floor. There is no cleanliness in the basement and sometimes the basement is flooded. Construction of the building is very poor the civil line of the building is not very good. We don't get daily need items easily and have to go to a mall. There is no home delivery of milk, bread etc. Rooms are very congested or small but the hall is extra large so the layout of the apartment is not that good.",

We have intercom system, verification process of maids as well as vehicles,which is excellent. CCTV cameras are there but they are not started yet. Guards are appointed day and night at each tower and they are very efficient in their part. Amenities are fine but the swimming pool is not operational as yet which they had promised five years back. In sports facility, badminton and tennis court are there. Playing indoor and outdoor games are allowed. More green and open areas are there which they maintain very well. We have two basements and each flat has one slot of parking,some residents got two slots as well. I have no issues with parking as I live alone and do not have any car with me. There are a total of 17 towers in FRESCO and every house is tolerating the seepage problem. Since we face a lot of seepage issue, the Unitech does not even bother to look in it as they dont have sufficient funds to make it better. Electricity backup is 100%. House cleaners are easily available at reasonable cost. The quality of lifts is fine as sometimes they stop working. This place is heaven for senior citizens as I have made many friends here. Infrastructure is good as there is no noise pollution but approachable roads are bad and it is closed from last month due to which people suffer a lot of problems. I had selected this place because I love the friendly environment and we celebrate many festivals together here. In addition, greenery is another factor for the selection of this place.",

Multipurpose house is used for many purposes so one has to pay when somebody is using it. Greenery is there and it is the best part of the society. Parking facilities are there but I got parking in the basement,and if someone has more than two cars then it is a challenge. They are trying to find a solution for that, but now they are parking on the ground floor and anywhere where they get space. Visitor parking is outside. In terms of construction, quality and maintenance is not good,and could have been improved. \u00a0Everything is available in the society and also the maids. In terms of locality, this is one of the best societies. The only negative thing about this society is the problem of seepage. Other than this, this is the best society to live.",

There are few good amenities here like a lot sports options available for every age category like: Squash, Tennis, TT and pool table, there\u2019s a gym with good facilities. The security here is very good as it\u2019s a gated community and you have guards at each tower as well, and proper checking is taken in each phase. The roads within the society are not well maintained and are broken, the buildings are fine the quality of the lifts is also good. Parking is not disciplined here as there\u2019s a lot of mismanagement here regarding parking space which has caused a problem for both residents and visitors. The layout of the apartments is efficient as the rooms are quite spacious with big balconies and you get proper sunlight as well. Maids are very easily available and we have markets like Nirvana Courtyard and F-block market located very near from our society.",

There is a badminton court, a play room where events like story telling etc. take place and there are coaches who come to the society to train the kids. We have around 2 parks which are well maintained and there are 2 kids play area too. We are given 2 parking spaces with the apartment; the parking is in both the basements 1 and 2. There are separate visitor parking spaces provided too. The main problem is related to the infrastructure; there are seepage issues and AC leakages but the response on complaint is good. We have 100% power backup. There are gas pipelines which is better than normal gas cylinders. This society is good for senior citizens, kids as well as families as events are conducted regularly during festivals etc.",

Basically, there are more renters here, so they are not that interested in the society development and don\u2019t care much. Most of the flats are incomplete; there are 3 towers which are under construction. Moreover the quality of the apartments which are occupied is also not that good. For example,the slope in the washroom for the water to exit is in the opposite direction which takes the water away from the drainage and towards the rooms. This is the case in almost all the flats. There are a lot of seepage issues; the paint on the walls is coming off. When we file a complaint they say that the problem will be solved by evening, but there isn\u2019t any response.When we go to the office personally they tell us to come after 2 days and after 2 days they tell us that they are trying to find a very good plumber. So they always have some excuse for not solving the problem and the complaint is never transferred into action. The contract that we signed does not have any time frame for the delivery of the flat but there are time frames for the payment that has to be made by us. The mistake that Unitech made was that they took the money from us even before the flats were completed and with that money they purchased more plots rather than completing the ongoing construction and they even opened the booking for the flats that are going to be constructed on the plots purchased and made more money. Majority of the renters have taken loan from the bank and when they don\u2019t get that on time,no one knows who will pay this loan plus people don\u2019t have time to go to the court too.Since they are not able to deliver the flat on time, they say that they will pay us Rs.5 per sqft. They basically are playing hide and seek. There are Supreme Court cases on Unitech, but they are broke so they don\u2019t have any money to settle the cases too. Before giving us the apartments, they have to get an NOC from HUDA; fit for habitation certificate, which is also not available with them. The owners rent their flats and later if they want to transfer the flat to the renter\u2019s name then the builders ask for about 2 lakhs for this. The security system is ok. The guards should know the people living within the society, but they even ask the owners about where they live every time we enter the society, which is irritating. I think one of the main amenities is the swimming pool, which is not functional yet. There is a gym, but many people don\u2019t use it. The grass in the parks is all dry due to lack of water, they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the gardener and the cleanliness is maintained here just because of the people living here. The concept of this society is excellent on papers but in reality it is not the same. There are things that the builder has not delivered plus there is no one that can be held responsible in the main office. Indians have learnt how to live in distress and we are continuing to do the same.",

Vehicle and house cleaner verification process are amazing. Cameras are installed but only at the main entrance not in every tower but every tower has their own security guard, which is good enough, and they are doing a good job. Intercoms are not working from last 2 or 3 months, but they promised to do it in this month only. We are not that much satisfied with amenities, as they are not well maintained. Swimming pool is not operational. It should be good. There is enough open and green areas and they take care of it.Parking is horrible.We have basement 1 and basement 2 in which only basement 1 is operational and there is no allocation of parking space, it is based on first come and first park basis. So sometimes, if we come after 12 at night, there is no guarantee that we will get a space for our car or not that is why it is bad and also it is not safe as there is no security guard present in the basement. Visitors can park anywhere they want to. Infrastructure is poor or we can say it is horrible as seepage is the main problem in our society, which has not been corrected yet. Corridor light is not proper as we are not able to see properly in it. In addition, no safety measures are there. If we talk about the layout of the apartment then it is not proper as balconies are too small. We are four members in the family so if we want to sit in the balcony together for teatime it is not possible. House cleaners are not easily available as there is a strong union of them that makes it difficult in finding new ones and they are highly priced too.There is no uniformity in their prices and for the same service in different houses they charge differently. Qualities of lifts are not good at all, anyone can vomit or urinate there and no one is there to take care of that. This place is too pet friendly as dogs  poop anywhere they want. Owners do not take care of such things. Therefore, maintenance should be more vigilant with pet owners. RWA are pathetic as they are not doing their work efficiently. Construction is very poor of this society.",

There is enough space for parking so no issues with that too. Greenery is the best part of this society and it is really well maintained.

Good schools and hospitals are nearby. Sewage is a regular problem otherwise fresco is a good place to live.",

Maid verification is done,and they don't allow the maids to come for more than 30 days if the pass has not been made for entering the society. Everything is good in the clubhouse,and whatever you require for exercises like steppers, treadmill, TV, music, sauna, steam bath etc.are available here. We have many sports facilities in the society like lawn tennis court, cricket ground, and badminton court, separate kids play area, multipurpose hall etc. Unitech always provides greenery and that's the best part of Unitech Developers.Parking is just below our tower so it is very convenient, for us atleast. Visitor parking is on the ground floor. There is limited space for visitor parking so they should provide more visitors parking. Anyway, we have never faced a problem in this context. Still, more space should be provided for the visitors so that it is convenient for them. They should provide visitor parking in the basement itself. However, they have provided a separate area for that but still it needs some improvement. We are facing too much seepage problem. This is the only problem due to which the people shift to other societies. Otherwise, everything is good here. If seepage problem resolves then it is an excellent society to live in. For water supply, we don't face any problem,though we have installed RO in our house.",

The clubhouse is good and there are no worries regarding it. The gym is quite good, tennis court, badminton court etc. overall, all the facilities are nice. Kids play area is good and spacious. Kids can run around play football, and cricket and they are happy with it so am I, we get some time to ourselves too. There is a green area within the society and kids are allowed to play in the park. We have two basement floors for parking. If anyone has a problem there then they park their car on the ground in open spaces. Otherwise, it is good. If everyone parks his or her car in a designated parking area then there never is a problem with the parking. They need to work on the seepage and on the building. Seepage is the biggest problem here.The designing of the flat is also not good,the roof is falling off and I think they don't use very good material for construction. It is not done too well but you just can't help it. Unitech properties have a seepage problem. You can't stand out on the balcony otherwise the plaster will fall off.",

Sewage and piping are a big problem here as continuous leakage is there and apartment layout is poor, construction quality is also doubtful. There is sufficient staff for all the maintenance.

At our house, we repaired the seepage problem so we are not facing any of it. Still, many apartments are facing this problem. There are many good schools nearby like Ipsa school my granddaughter goes there, Silva gaint, Kamla International School etc. We have many markets nearby like F Block, B Block, D Block market and JMART that is outside the society. Paras Hospital is a little bit far away but somewhat nearby. We also get autos nearby. There is a power backup for electricity supply.Its a senior citizen friendly society and in the evenings we all sit together. Maids are ok and they are easily available. We are living here from last 5 years.Security is average in the society even though the guards are there all the time.They take care of everything like the kids, on whom they keep an eye and dont let them go out without permission.When any visitor comes, they always inform us on the intercom.

Condition of the building is poor from outside & inside as well. Improvement is required because the cement is chipping off.Its a pretty expensive society, looks like it is 10 years old due to the quality of construction. Lifts are sluggish, otherwise all is ok.Pets are allowed but there is no designated place for their poop as other societies have. Good for senior citizens.

Security is excellent as no one is allowed to enter without permission and proper verification. Every tower contains individual guards for the lift, security and other purposes. Greenery is the best part of fresco with ample number of parks and lawns being present here which are well maintained. There are a large numbers of trees which make the atmosphere pleasant and cool. Amenities are there but safety is an issue with them as there are swings for children but these are not well maintained and children often get hurt due to this.Apart from this there is a gym which is good but is missing some equipments. There is a squash court and badminton court in the clubhouse itself which is good.Also, there is a lawn tennis court in the open and also a cricket net which are also in good shape. Parking slots are provided to everyone but no one follows the rules, people here park in open which creates problems, visitors are allowed to park inside the society in open areas. Infrastructure is fine but in some areas roads are damaged and in some these are under-construction so this should be fixed. Good schools and hospitals are within reach and a market is also nearby. Electricity is never a problem here as efficient power backup is provided and quality of water is very good. Sewage is a big problem here as pipes are broken in some places but we can\u2019t do nuch as now it is already constructed and we have to manage in the same. Apart from these it is pleasant to stay here,I hope they can provide a separate pet area.",

This place is easy to walk-in and manageable. The layout is good and the space is more open and green. Security is good but few improvements should be done as soon as possible like efficient guards and installation of CCTV cameras on the main door. Intercom facility is also not working which creates security issues. Amenities are good like the kids play area is there. We have some sports facilities like badminton court, squash court, table tennis and people can play cricket too because of the big lawns here. Gym and fitness activities are there. However, clubhouse is in under construction that they had promised to be there from last one and half year though they could not make it. Green and open areas are excellent here. Each flat has their own two basements parking that make it good but parking is not managed well,in addition, RWA is not working well. Infrastructure is average in this project as there is a lot of seepage issue and FRESCO is known for it is seepage problem. Pollution is not a problem in this project. Electricity back up is 100%. House cleaners are easily available and their charges are decent. The society is senior citizen friendly but lifts are not working well. This society is pet friendly. I like this place because such places are difficult to find.",

Verification did not happen earlier but now it has been started. Maids verification is done in the starting itself. But the issues comes every day. Passes are there for maids without that no one can enter into the society. CCTV are there in the society but I am not sure they are in a working condition. The clubhouse is there and I always use the gym. Swimming is there but not functional but they are saying it will be functional from next year. We get sports facility in the society like tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, cricket pitch, there is ground where you can play cricket or football both. There are two kids play area available in the society. The gym is air-conditioned and that way they well maintained. Comparison to other places, this is the best place in terms of greenery. Open spaces are there which are big enough. I stay with my wife here. And my son lives in Wellington Apartment. Parking is the best here we have basement parking for resident and for visitors parking open spaces on ground floor. Few people reserve 1 parking space or some people have 2 reserve parking which is a must but the second or third you can purchase. There is a seepage problem in few towers. In my tower, initially there was a seepage problem but now it is rectified but still few towers have a seepage problem. Plenty of good schools and markets are nearby. And plenty of good hospitals is nearby. One drawback of the society is we don't have easy access to public transport. Everybody has to have cars there otherwise, there is a problem. We are two people having two bedrooms which is enough for us. Best water supply is there but still I had already installed RO system at my home. I am a Senior citizen and I have a pet too. The society is pet-friendly and there is a separate dedicated poop up area for pets. For senior citizen, there is a dedicated room in the clubhouse. Society events are organized and every person celebrates or participates in that.",

The lawn and the play area is good but it is maintained very poorly and there is no functional swimming pool here. The parking is pretty convenient for the residents as well as for the visitors. The main problem is that there is a large amount of leakage in almost all the apartments. The construction quality is very poor; all the plasters and paints are chipping off. Even the quality of the parking area is very bad. The good is that the events and social activities are conducted quite regularly. The neighborhood is excellent; there are really good people around and it is good fun.",

From Day 1 I have rats coming into my house which for me is very bad. I am in T-14 and still T-17 is not developed. Even the roads inside are not developed, clubhouse activities are very poor. I am staying because I am a tenant and it hardly matters to me but I would think twice while owning an apartment here. Maintenance is not good here at all. Clubhouse is very poor.",

The gym is fine. There is a kid play area, which is well-maintained and cleaned properly. Green and open areas are good and are maintained though we can always have more of the green area.Kids are allowed in the parks to play but they also get scolded for that. We have a ground on the backside of the society where they play soccer,though it can be dangerous for the senior citizens who sit in the park.There should be more playground to play soccer. We also had a word with the president of the society, who said that they would arrange some park for the kids to play soccer. We usually park our car on the ground floor,only if we do not get the space then we park in the basement. But the situation underground is very bad. All the cars are parked on the side of the road and sometimes it becomes difficult to move the cars, so they should not allow anyone to park their car on the ground floor. Visitors also park their cars anywhere in the open spaces. One reserve-parking slot is available for the entire residents. Roads have cracks and jerks and needs lots of improvement. Security is good and I am satisfied with it. Verification is also there and overall amenities are good,though they can maintain it better.There is a seepage problem in the building. Infrastructure is not good and because of some occasion or festivals like Diwali, there is air and noise pollution.The society members do not allow anyone to fire crackers on Diwali. Artemis hospital is also nearby. There is scope for improvement in everything but the apartment size is small. Power cuts are very frequent but we have power backup,so, there are no issues with electricity. People have pets so they should have another area for them because usually, adults say that kids might get hurt. People feel quite comfortable here and they have their separate sitting area where they sit and chat.",

Each time someone comes in, a record is maintained and if there is a visitor for us then we get a call, but the only issue is that their intercoms don\u2019t work at times. Sometimes even the guard accompanies the visitor to our flat. There are CCTV cameras at some places and there are passes for the maids and they do a strict check every time. There is a good clubhouse which has a kids' play room, a media room where senior citizens can relax and watch television or play cards and there are courts for tennis, badminton, and squash. There is a gym too with good equipments. The green area is good and the open areas are great here plus they are well maintained too. The parking spaces are enough in number; there are 2 areas for parking but at the moment just one is functional. The visitors have to park their vehicles outside, they don\u2019t have parking space within the society but it is inside the gate of the society. The infrastructure is not great; the basics like gas, electricity, the back-up, the water supply etc. are good but the outer part has to be maintained better. The lifts are not very functional, there are some issues. The apartment layout is good but the outer look is an issue. There are not much seepage issues in our tower. The society is very active; all events are conducted well. It is good for everyone,so be it the senior citizens, bachelors or families. The thing that attracted us the most is, one, the linkage to the highway, the Sohna road or the golf course extension road, two, the location of the society and lastly the open spaces in the society; we are looking to shift out because we need a bigger apartment but we end up liking this society because of the open space and still havent shifted.We get sunlight the whole time the sun is out, so the dampness is not there at all.",

There are very well maintained lush green areas with small kids play area with rides etc. for the kids. The clubhouse is excellent. It has a good gym, a very good swimming pool and yoga room. It also has a yoga room, carom boards, badminton court and table tennis tables. The security here is pretty good; there are guards but it is not very systematic. It is not very techy too; that is there is no biometric lock or CCTV camera etc. There are cards issued for the workers within the society without which they cannot enter the society, but anyone can get access to that card too. There are intercoms but they are not used always. It is a very senior citizen friendly society. They provide us with one allotted parking space and if you have an extra car you can purchase an extra parking space. There is a separate space within the society where the visitors can park their vehicles. We face a small challenge with electricity at times as there are frequent cut offs but it is not a problem because we do have 100% power backup. There are in-house stores like J-mart, a chemist shop, grocery store and a barber shop too. The quality of the roads outside the society connecting to the society and the roads connecting to Sohna road is terrible which has to be improved. But overall, the society is fantastic.",

As compare to Delhi I would say it is excellent. Amenities are very good, we have a small gym, you can say home gym with not much of the types of machinery some of them are available. In sports facilities, we have a badminton court, basketball court, a small swimming pool. The swimming pool is not functional right now. It is completed there is only one problem that is a license that is it. We have more than enough greenery in the society. It is excellent I do not think there will be such greenery any of the societies nearby. It is one of the best having in terms of maintenance, cleanliness of greenery. Residents parking are good, visitors parking is ok because there is no dedicated parking for visitors. Because the society is 12 or 13 years old society, but it is manageable. Infrastructure is good; it is good or old but according to that it is good, I have selected this project because of location. It is located on Sohna Road. All the facilities are available like public transport is available only at a walking distance. Haldiram, Big Bazar all the things are at walking distance. The approach is very easy.

The green and open area is just excellent as about 75%-80% is opening (green + concrete). There is one big park which is divided into 2 parts; one half for the kids and the other half for the senior citizens as the ball games played by the children might hurt the senior citizens. The parking facility is also excellent; each resident has 1 allotted parking and they can even purchase an extra parking if it is necessary. The visitors have parking spaces within the society itself; there are around 5 visitor parking spaces with each tower. It is a new society; it has just been 2 years so there hasn\u2019t been any issue so far. It is a new area; it has just 2-3 societies in this area. There is a grocery and a chemist stores. The 2BHK flats have a size of 1500 sqft which is typically for 3BHK. It is very luxuries. The water supply was an issue till a few months back but now it is resolved. There is a good sense of community here; there are jagraatas organized for the senior citizens, fashion show for the kids. The location of the society is bad but rest everything is great.",

Overall amenities are average as there is only a tennis court, which is not properly maintained.For the clubhouse they charge extra charges which are pretty expensive as compared to other societies.The kids play area is decent but you will find most of the kids playing on the road itself while playing badminton or skating etc. There are lots of green open areas and we have a big open lawn area. There are two separate parks in the society that is well developed. Overall infrastructure is good.Interior of the apartment is pretty good. One school is opposite to our society,market is nearby and we also have a store within the society. A good hospital is there though independent doctors are available nearby.",

Even if I buy the property, even if I am in rental everything is included, so that is excellent. It is very green and te society is set in around 11 acres. There are 11 towers and huge parks for running sprints.Parking is very convenient for both the visitors and residents. I have two covered parking,for a 4 BHK,and I always get a dedicated visitor parking and its good as we have frequent guests.Security is awesome, amazing, and excellent because the security is handled by Knight Frank Company. It is a top-level company in security management.No visitors are allowed at my place without prior information through the intercom. So it is a full proof security and I am very happy with it. Overall the infrastructure is amazing. The entire Bestech property infrastructure is best with very good schools nearby. There is a play school within the society. DPS primary school and DPS School is also closeby. The market is in the society itself. There are many good hospitals nearby like Medanta, Cloud Nine, and Park Hospital etc.",

Parks are well maintained and children are allowed to play there. Parking is convenient but sometimes it becomes crowded. We have two slots of parking. RWA is very active. There was a little fight for availability of house cleaners but now we have got one. The quality of lifts is good. This place is senior citizen friendly.

There\u2019re sufficient beautiful parks and lawns which are very well maintained by the RWA here and since it\u2019s a 20yr old society they initiate the efforts to maintain it perfectly as well. There\u2019s no clubhouse here but only a small indoor games room which has Table Tennis Table and carom board games. Parking is pretty well organised here as I guess every resident has 1- car parking space available. The place is really good for senior citizens as they have seats arranged for them in parks to sit and the roads are much broader here. In this society you\u2019ll only see tenants living here and not much owners as it\u2019s a 2bhk property so you\u2019ll find either small families or bachelors staying here.",

Guards are allocated at several points. Clubhouse is not functional in our project. Kids play area and sports facility are available.  Ample of parking space is available and for visitors, it is closed in the society only. Roads are fine inside the society but not on the outside. Maintenance is very poor as construction quality is poor and lot of seepage occurs in the houses. House cleaners are easily available. The quality of lifts is awful as sometimes they are not working.

The ground level is completely green and no cars are allowed at this level, they have to use the basement. The parking facility is good but there are more cars than the number of parking slots so it so kind of difficult to find a place to park near your flat. You can purchase an extra car parking though but it costs around 5 lakhs,plus the visitors have to park outside the society. The infrastructure was terrible when we took over but now it is good. There is a filtration plant, power backup etc. The apartments are also spacious and it is open on both the sides with huge running balconies.The security is just average because the guards keep on changing and they are not that well trained.Moreover there is no tech involved in the security system which I think is necessary.All events are conducted during the festivals etc. but it would be great if the music played during these events were softer.

Infrastructure is good because you have common facility then if something is broken they overdue it and construct it again. We have lots of construction going around right now.

Green and open areas are good but maintenance part is average. Green areas are the main USP of Park View. There is restriction for children to play in parks but there is no specific area for them so they play in that area only. Security check is efficient and cameras are installed everywhere. House cleaners are verified efficiently and guards are located at main gate and parking. Clubhouse is present but not everything is available which we need and quality of swings can be better( which is below average). Swimming pool is working. House cleaners are easily available.

Security is good but security system should be improved, security guards are not checking properly and anybody can hide anything in clothes and take inside the society. One drawback is there like kirtans and all are not allowed on a regular basis but only during festivals.If someone wants to do a 'Tuesday kirtan',they are not allowed to do so in the clubhouse.They can do it their respective homes.In comparison to other societies this society is very good. All the activities are there for kids. The swimming pool is there in the clubhouse. Ample parking is available, dedicated visitor parking is there. There is no problem in parking. Infrastructure is good. Malls are nearby and good hospitals are also nearby like Max, Fortis, Medanta, and Park Hospitals etc. We have in-house shops are here so we get daily need items easily.",

Only one thing is here that they are taking huge money from coaches, which is not good. They charge high amount per kid so coaches also increase their charges, and now they are hesitating to come here.Clubhouse facilities are good but not that good because I used to use the treadmill but most of the time its fully occupied. We have to wait for one to two hours to use that. Therefore, gym equipment is few in comparison to the residents in the society but other things in the clubhouse are very good. Greenery is too good and very well maintained. Pets are allowed in the society and they have poop areas for them but most of the time you see on the road also.

Maids are verified efficiently and guards are located at main gate and every tower. Clubhouse is completely working and also we have room for kids in club area, gym, table tennis and everything which is required. This project is completely green and well-maintained. Children are not allowed as per the rules but they used to play, as there is no specific area for them to play. Parking is enough as we can park in basement and we have option to rent out as well. Visitors are also satisfied by their parking space as 20 parking space for each tower is available for visitors.Infrastructure is fine like streetlights are working well but roads are under the process to make the roads again. We have not faced any issue on seepage. There is noise pollution because of Bestech that is just behind our project. House cleaners are easily available it is just depends upon person to person. The quality of lifts is medium which need to be replaced over a period of time. This place is friendly for seniors. We are five people in the family and size of the apartment is 3 BHK plus 1. We selected this place based on greenery, nearness to my work place and layout of the apartment.",

Also there\u2019s a lot of open area which is used for cycling, skating and even used for strolling pets. The security is very good and effective here as there is adequate staffing, and they focus on continuous training, the guards are well mannered. CCTV\u2019s are here but I have no idea how many of them are operational. The intercom is not a standard one and the guards usually call us on our mobile to confirm which is unsafe and crazy at times but overall the security is pretty good and decent. In terms of amenities we have a decent clubhouse with basic range of sports facility like: Basketball Court and Tennis Court. The gym is just fine but not that well maintained and there\u2019s a swimming pool which doesn\u2019t have sauna & steam option. Parking is quite convenient here for residents as there\u2019s a 2 level underground basement parking for the residents but there\u2019s no facility of lifts going to the basement level which is considered to be a problem  as we have to walk up and down and its even much problems especially for the older people. The quality of the lifts are just average so is the infrastructure as its getting old now but now efforts are being taken for its maintenance, though the layout is pretty efficient as we live in a spacious 4bhk apartment. The place is very senior citizen friendly as facilities like a library, sit out area and cardroom place is provided for them. The residents are very socially active as they keenly take part in various festive events. There are quite a few schools and hospitals within the proximity of 2-4 kms. There\u2019s an in-house store from where we get all our basic daily items quite easily and we get 100% power backup with 24x7 electricity and regular supply of water as well. Overall it\u2019s a very good place to live with family.",

City services and autos are easily available in terms of public transport. The layout of the apartment is very good. 24*7 power backup is there. For senior citizens we have benches in the park, meeting rooms, cards room etc. This society is very good because this is the first project of the Bestech Builder.",

Road construction quality is not good.I always have a concern about security but the security is good, normally guards check all the people who come in, and CCTV are working well too. I do not find any problem in that as each lift has a CCTV and outside the lobby lifts are not that good. Every time they suffer a breakdown and every time maintenance people come and maintain it,otherwise it is good.  There are no issues in the parking. Streetlights are good. Construction quality is ok in comparison to DLF projects. The society is senior citizen friendly.

Also inside the society we have half-way walking track, pretty open areas and big park where we do Yoga every morning and celebrate birthdays of every senior citizen in this society.Apart from that we also organise functions like Diwali Mela, Christmas carnival and there was a point of time when RP-II hosted the first ever Dhandia night in Gurgaon. The infrastructure is one of the best in NCR, as far as the construction quality is concerned,it is really good and the buildings are highly compatible against earthquake,the lifts are ageing but still operational,also the layout and structure of these buildings is very effective and good. Parking is very convenient as there\u2019s ample amount of space for both visitors and residents. Maids are available easily but really expensive if you have to hire them. One of the best thing about this place is its security as its excellent, the guards are pretty responsive, there\u2019s regular surveillance conducted by the guards and the guards do patrolling in every 15mins in the basement area in order to check if any strange things are being done in the parking lot. The children are safe here and they are not allowed to go out with their maids or drivers until proper consent is received from the parent.In this society we get regular supply of water and 24x7 electricity with 100% power backup without any breaks. This society from my point of view is the best society in Gurgaon.",

Parking is provided 1 per resident and ample amount of parking is there for visitors. It is a senior citizen friendly society but keeping pets can be a problem due to some recent issues. Various group activities are also performed for seniors.",

There\u2019re security facilities such as CCTV and intercoms and the guards always call us on the intercom if someone has come to meet us. The place is really safe for the kids and proper and efficient surveillance are been done by the guards here. The infrastructure is good and maintenance is done round the clock and the staff are always responsive.The layout is so good as we get good sunlight when compared with X and Y towers. Parking is very convenient for both residents and visitors here and if a resident has to get one more space then he needs to rent that parking space. The parks and green areas are a bit limited here, but they are pretty well maintained as we have seasonal flowers that grow in this society and its very different from the rest of condominium societies. All the community gather and celebrate various events in this park very high and in a lively manner. The place is quite friendly for senior citizens and two days back they had a sports event in the park. There\u2019s a common clubhouse but you need to pay a premium which is very competitive but apart from that you get basic sports facilities and no swimming pool and when you compare it with the other societies in terms of amenities it is quite less. Apart from that we have a salon, meat super market and a grocery store inside the society and popular places and markets like Gallria, Vyapar Kendra and Supermart I which is nearby and within the society we have Shri Ram School ad Shiv Nadar in around 2kms and around 3 good reputed hospitals : Max, Fortis and Medanta. If you consider this place geographically it is conveniently located to all the prime places which make it a really good place to live.",

These are the oldest condomiums. Good projects are coming up but they are very far from here. They are well-maintained, big condomiums are there and are spread in a range of two KMS with good space to walk. Infrastructure is very fine as streetlights are little dingy but soon they are going to change it with more accurate lights. Roads are well maintained. They are redoing the paint of the whole society and we had not face any issue over seepage. Green and open areas are not enough but it is ok. There are three to four spaces which are cleaned and maintained and very tidy as well. Children are allotted with a specific space for them to play. Amenities are good like gym and library are there. In sports facility, basketball, skating and karate are available here. Mostly people have one parking but if we have another car, we can purchase space. Visitors can park on the extreme corners of the road. Therefore, parking is not an issue here. Security is excellent as cameras are installed in the basement, lifts and in the common area. Verification system is efficient and 100% working. House cleaners do not enter without their passes and it is compulsory for them to wear passes within premises. Guards are at every tower and they are well behaved. House cleaners are easily available and quality of lifts is improving. This place is very senior citizen friendly as lot of activities are planned for them like yoga and kirtans and they keep themselves busy. There is nothing to beat this place.",

Parking is fine as every resident has one slot of parking with them and visitors can park on the sides of the road for just half an hour.Infrastructure is fine as enough streetlights are there, roads are good and also no seepage problem.

The security is very good and efficient as every resident is provided with an access card and display ID card is given to the maids as well. The guards are very responsive and vigilant and keep an account of all in and out entries of the visitors. There\u2019s a big green park which is quite sufficient which has a separate place for the kids to play as well and proper sit out and seating\u2019s have been put in the park for the senior citizens and various events for the senior citizens are also conducted in these parks as well and there\u2019s ample amount of open areas within the society and the place is quite suitable for the pets as well. The park in RP-II is also used by the member from other societies as well. There\u2019s common DLF city club and you need to take a membership in order to use it, there\u2019s no place or venue for parties and in terms of sports facilities we only have a skating rink and basketball court. Apart from that in terms of amenities we have got an in-house grocery store Needs wherein we get all our necessary items very easily and markets like Galleria and SuperMart-1 and Vyapar Kendra are just within the vicinity of this society where there a lot of restaurants, eating joints, clinics as well. We get 100% power backup with 24x7 electricity and regular water supply.  Parking is pretty fine here as space of 2 vehicles per space is allotted for the residents and if they need an extra space they\u2019ll have to pay for it and no such problems are faced regarding parking here and even for visitors parking is quite conveniently available.  The infrastructure is not up to the mark as the layout is not specific here as least priority has been taken for RP-II in terms of maintenance when compared with Windsor Court and Hamilton Court, but now efforts are being made for its maintenance since it\u2019s an old society. But apart from that this society is centrally located and within condominium area there\u2019s Shri Ram School and hospitals like Fortis and Max are just a few minutes away. Overall it\u2019s a convenient and a good place to live.",

Both the clubhouse and the swimming pool are under construction and not operational yet and I think it will become open to all by next year. There's only big park here and I guess that's sufficient enough as the society is quite small. Parking is easily available here as there is parking available for residents in the basement and open parking space available outside for visitors.

I workout so I know the gym is good but I don\u2019t have ideas about other amenities. Parks and lawns are ample and well maintained, environment is clean and pleasant. Residential parking is in basement and proper slots are there for everyone,though the visitors have to park in open. Construction is poor, especially the outer portions, it is visible and is decaying very fast. Schools, markets and everything else is situated in close proximity. Electricity is 24*7 available with backup, Water is clean and regular.Public transport is not accessible and if construction and sewage problem is removed I will recommend this place to other people.",

The maids are given passes without which they are not allowed to enter the society. The maids and other workers are checked and frisked properly while entering and leaving the society. There is a clubhouse which is just ok; there is a good gym, a party hall and table tennis tables. There is a small kid\u2019s play area which is pretty well maintained so the kids can play there. I haven\u2019t seen any outdoor sports facility. The green area is very well maintained and enough but I feel there can be more flowers here. The parking facility is kind of a problem; the underground parking is not enough. Each apartment is allotted with just 1 parking space and there is no parking for visitors within the society they have to park their cars outside. There were seepage problems at first but they are resolved now. I feel that there is a need for refurbishment. There are stores within the society so basic need items are available easily. They have provided us with 100% power backup. And the events are organized in a good manner during the festivals.",

We have a basketball court, badminton court, and lawn tennis court. They have maintained very good amount of greenery and even their horticulture team outside the society are maintaining it very well, so they are doing good with open areas also being maintained nicely. Parking of the society is certain. If you come after 10 pm or 11 pm then the reserved parking is good but open parking has issues.They defined a visitors parking like 5 to 6 per towers. So I can say that this is sufficient for the visitors.Senior citizens have a clubhouse in which they have carom room, cards room inside that they have benched for their comfort zone. They take care of each and everything. They never allow kids to play in senior citizen area because they may get hurt.",

But there\u2019s less of open space here which could have been better and the parks are significantly less for the number of towers.Parking is very convenient here as there\u2019s basement and ground parking available and every resident has got one reserved parking for their vehicle and ample space for visitors parking.These spaces are managed well and systematically.The infrastructure is better here and the construction quality is also good but in some places there are seepage issues but the RWA manages it quite well.There\u2019s ample number of balconies in each flat, also, the gentry here is very good. We have got one in-house grocery store as well the one from where we get all our daily necessary items quite easily. Overall this place a pretty good place to live with family.",

House cleaners have to go under police verification for their entry passes. Every tower has one guard and rest are on the main gate. Amenities are good. There are two plots,A and B and each plot has one clubhouse with facilities and where different courts are available like badminton, lawn tennis and cricket court. For children,a small park is there in which few swings are present.Green and open space is there and gardeners take care of the horticulture. Parking is average as nowadays every house has 2 to 3 cars and even the space is not enough so sometimes residents park their other vehicles in the visitors' parking which creates issue because then the visitors have to park their car outside the society.There are no extra charges for parking if visitors park outside the society. I would say that infrastructure is fine though we have seepage in a lot of towers. There is a good backup of electricity and it comes back within seconds. House cleaners are easily available and their charges are around 8k to 15k for 12 hours and for just cleaning they charge 2500/- to 3000/-. The quality of lifts is good and they maintain it properly. There are some issues regarding the pets as RWA is anti-pets and this needs to be worked on. I had selected this place because we prefer Vastu and this apartment is made according to Vastu. Secondly, it comes under my budget, away from crowded places and my kid's school is near this place.",

There is no much problem related to the construction quality. There are no parks as such but there is a fountain with a little greenery. For security there are boom barriers, CCTV cameras installed. It is a gated society and there are guards in each tower. The cars of the residents are given stickers and there are passes for the maids and other workers. We have a clubhouse which is big enough to organize a gathering of 30-40 people and there is a small room to play. There is badminton and a squash court in the clubhouse. There are 2 well maintained swimming pool and about 3 kids play area here. The parking facility is pretty good. I have 3 cars but I have just 1 allotted parking space. I cannot purchase extra car parking spaces as I guess there is some rule that parking spaces cannot be sold, so I have to pay Rs. 500 fine every month as I want to park my car within the society. The visitors have no allotted space within the society for parking so they have to just park outside. We have 100% power backup here so we don\u2019t feel like the power is gone when it is actually gone. There are about 2 in-house stores; J-mart and another store but not everything is available here. The quality of the lifts is terrible; they don\u2019t stop where it is supposed to stop. Very good events are conducted during the festivals.",

The society looks good from outside and the construction quality is also good; there hasn\u2019t been any issues so far related to the infrastructure. It has well maintained green spaces but most of this area is occupied by cars as they have provided us only with just 1 parking and it is not sufficient. If you have extra car then there is an option to purchase an extra parking too. We have a clubhouse here but it is not good enough but is pretty sufficient. The swimming pool is not of the best of standards, it is a normal kid\u2019s pool. There are good equipments in the gym but I feel the number of equipments is not sufficient. There are card rooms and yoga classes so senior citizens sit here and spend time. There is a badminton court, a lawn tennis court and a basketball court too. The security here is excellent; there CCT cameras installed. They have proper organized way to letting people in the society. They frisk the workers properly every time and there are passes for the maids too. They use the intercoms installed to the mark and there are good guards. The best thing here is the maintenance; the people in the office are very responsive. The layout of the apartments is not that great. One thing is that they have not procured plots in appropriate proportion so it is kind of disorganized. We have 100% power backup so there is no problem with electricity here. There are 3 shops inside so basic items are available easily but there are no markets nearby so have to go the MG road or Sohna road for markets. The safety systems are very good and they do a lot of testing of the security systems and they do good drills which are really helpful to identify security issues plus it a good practice for the people.",

Only parking is an issue that we still face here as it was promised by the builder that there were will be two levels of basement parking  but nothing has been done regarding it as only half of it has been built yet.Rest, we have all the amenities here like the clubhouse, all sports facilities and there\u2019s a separate hall to organise parties.The security is very good as there are guards most of the time and no such incidents have been heard yet, there\u2019re CCTV and intercom facility also available. There\u2019s a lot of greenery here as there are quite a lot of parks here. The infrastructure is also pretty well maintained as the roads, lifts and the buildings in the society are in a good condition. Our society is conveniently located as markets like Nirvana Courtyard and Banni Square are just quite close and within the radius of 3-4kms there are several good in the area. Above all its an ideal place to live with family",

The layout is pretty efficient as in 3bhk apartment we have one additional study room and servants room with a separate entrance and ample balcony space.

Sports facilities are awesome. Parking is no problem when you have two cars but if you have more than two cars then there is a problem. For visitors, there is a problem because you have to wait for the approval but it is good because of security purposes. Infrastructure is also one of the best things, which I like the most.

House cleaners are not allowed without their IDs which is mandatory for the entry. Every four houses have one guard so it is more efficient. Clubhouse is operational and has one restaurant and gym in it. Swimming pool is functional in summers with clean water and full of hygiene. In sports facility, Tennis and badminton court are there. Green and open areas are amazing as we have 8 or 10 parks available which are well maintained. Kids are very safe as guards take proper care of them. Parking is very spacious as open parking space is available for everyone. Everyone has two slots of parking with each house. Visitors are very satisfied with it. Every two house has two streetlights on opposite sides. Roads are in good condition. We have not faced any issue over seepage.Schools are within a walking distance. House cleaners are easily available. The quality of lifts is good. This place is senior citizen friendly as they can meet in the park and club as well. This place is pet friendly too as they do take care of stray dogs as well.",

No CCTV cameras are installed here,but a few cameras are there below C Block meaning outside, but inside there are no CCTVs.Though there are cameras in lifts and lifts are very well maintained. So, security is very good. There is no clubhouse; you have to become a member of the DLF Club, which is right next door and which is the additional payment that you have to make.There are slides & swings. There is only a lawn available where you can play. There is lots of greenery in the society though, which is very well maintained, kids are allowed to play, and the society is pet-friendly. Parking is pretty convenient so no worries about that. We have one parking slot and if you have more than one car then you have to park outside. Infrastructure is excellent no issues in the roads,street lights, maintenance etc. The society is senior citizen friendly,there are open spaces for them they do their get together to sit around within the society.The senior citizens have a lot of common community celebration.",

There is no seepage issue, construction quality is good. Maintenance is good as well.There is a quick response to the problems and even the roads are ok.There are not enough parks but just 3 small parks for kids which are reasonably maintained. Pets are not allowed within the lawns. There are no clubhouses, no sport area for kids, only swings are there. There is no TT court. Security is very good though. CCTV are in lifts and outside the towers. Verification is done for the strangers entering into the society. Guards behavior is ethical. I feel safe here. Maids are available but expensive.

The amenities that we get here are really very good as there are a lot of in-house grocery stores wherein we get all our daily basic items very easily, there\u2019s a cobbler who comes every weekend to our society. There\u2019s a common clubhouse but the residents have to take club membership.  The security is really very good here as proper authentic checking is done when someone comes from outside and all security facilities like CCTV\u2019s and intercom facility are there. Parking is also good here as every resident has been allotted with parking space and if there\u2019s a need for extra space then there\u2019s facility for parking at the clubhouse as well. Parks and open areas are well sufficient here but kids are missing other sports facilities as they are not allowed to play in these parks. There\u2019s a separate area allotted for pets and proper place is assigned for senior citizens here and there\u2019s ladies club there where mostly the members are senior citizens. Housemaids are very easy to get here as when we moved in 2yrs ago we had maids keep on coming to our place to hire them. DLF phase 5 is one of the best locations in terms of everything like schools, markets and hospitals: Paras and Alchemist. There\u2019s no hassle or traffic faced in here as there are a lot of societies in this area so you don\u2019t face such issues.",

We just moved into this society around 11 months ago and so far the place has been really good as the society is really good for kids as there are enough parks for them to go and play and these parks are properly maintained. I found it really a safe and secure place as there\u2019s a two-tier security here as even if you get the confirmation from main gate, you\u2019re still not allowed to get in the flat unless the guards in each tower get the confirmation from the tenant or the owner. Intercom facility is really good here and there are CCTV cameras in each lift and in every corridors. In terms of amenities there\u2019s a clubhouse which requires a membership fee, maintenance staff are very easy to get here and there are a few in-house stores here in Wellington but we find it not much useful so we buy all our stuffs from the store in Princeton. The infrastructure is very good as we live in a 3bhk apartment so the rooms are spacious here; the lifts are really good and so does the roads. Parking is very convenient in our pocket but in some pockets the parking area is not that disciplined but visitors have a separate area for parking which is very convenient. There are not that many good markets around Phase 5 , so if we want to eat any street food we need to go to Suncity market or usually we shop things from Sadar Bazaar or from Delhi. The place is really good for senior citizens which make the community living really well. Housemaids are easily available here and the society is well maintained and there\u2019s cleanliness everywhere.",

Banks, shopping malls, taxi availability, schools, offices are nearby.We have no issues with the water supply and electricity supply. It is a safe and one of the best-maintained society amongst all the societies in that sector like Princeton etc. We are finding security is very alert security is very good. Guards are available and are attentive.They keep a check but the guards have no powers within their own restriction. There is no clubhouse,but swings and slides are there for kids.There is no sports facility as such existing within the complex. Kids play here but there is no dedicated place to play football or cricket etc. Only a few coaches are there for activities like karate skating etc. Greenery is good and nicely maintained. There is no such place for kids to play,and regular circulars are taken out barring the kids to play but as kids have no space to play so they continue playing there. The clubhouse is not the part of this society. It is the part of DLF.It is a beautiful clubhouse, in which swimming pool, tennis court etc. everything is available but we have to pay for that if we want to use those facilities. We have an ATM here in the society and 2 shopping center, laundry is also here. There are some facilities like the van is coming into the society every Saturday or Sunday for breakfast and dinner. This is on a paid basis who want to have it just purchase it. Parking is good residents plus visitor's normally get one slot for parking, but most of the people purchase more than one slots. Infrastructure is excellent everything is good. In public transport there are some autos available outside the society. The society is senior citizen friendly. We have sitting arrangements for every person and they come and sit together so there is no objection as such. There is a garden where we celebrate the festivals and senior women sit in that park and gossip and chat in the evenings.",

As in this society we get every basic amenity, there\u2019s an in-house grocery shop: Safal, we get various food stalls, and also on every weekend there\u2019s a cobbler who comes to our society. Apart from that there are few activities for kids in this society like karate and skating classes. There\u2019s a huge clubhouse close to our society but we need to take the clubhouse membership in order to use the clubhouse. We have 2-3 parks over here but the kids are not allowed to use the main ground to play with the ball,instead of that they have been allotted with a small park to play such sports. The parks are all well maintained on a regular basis here, there\u2019s a separate area outside the building for the pets to litter and roam around. The place is very senior citizen friendly and they have their own club by the name of Aastha and in every 6 months they organise small kitty parties and get together in the clubhouse. We haven\u2019t faced any problems in the past few years in terms of security as the guards here are quite efficient and they follow effective security measures. CCTV and intercom security systems are there and here. And the best part is if you inform the guard to arrange an auto for us, then the guards will make ensure that there\u2019s an auto ready for us when we reach at the main gate. The quality of the infrastructure is good since it\u2019s a DLF property so the quality of construction is good, we live in a 3bhk apartment so the layout and the design is quite effective and the place is well enough for 3 of us in the family. The roads here within the society were good but now they have made some changes to it due which the roads have become narrow and it\u2019s difficult sometimes when you\u2019re cycling. Parking is good here as every resident has got allotted parking space which is very convenient for us and there\u2019s a separate area for visitor parking as well. The place is very conveniently located near all schools and hospitals like Paras and Alchemist. We haven\u2019t faced any problems regarding electricity and water as there\u2019s 24X7 electricity and water supply. There\u2019s good engagement from the residents in this society as they actively participate and get together in every function and have a good time. Overall this is the best society to live with even better facilities.",

They are very careful about who is coming in the society. There has been no case of theft till now.Kids play area is not there as such but there is a garden, which is clean and maintained where kids can play, slides and swings are there.

The green area is there and very well maintained. Parking is good one parking slots is available to the residents and if someone has more than one car,then they have to purchase the slot, but for visitor parking is a challenge.There is a dedicated space for visitor parking but that is limited.

There is a clubhouse in which we have all the facilities like a clinic, swimming pool and gym. Kids play area is there in which we have slides and swings for kids. There is lots of greenery in the society. Open spaces are quite good. Kids are not allowed to play in all the parks, which is the worst part. There are many restrictions for kids. Pets are the worst problem here because I don't like when these pets make the whole society dirty. Because of this, the morning walk has become horrible.Moreover, this problem is not only in a society but the whole of Gurugram. Parking is very convenient for the residents,we have 1 parking slots, many people have more than one parking slot.Visitor parking is there in every block. Infrastructure within the society is good. For senior citizens,the club W3 park is there.Because of security reasons I have chosen this society.",

There is no free club and if you want to become a member there is a DLF Clubhouse, which has paid membership. There is no community hall within the society. Swings and slides for kids are there which are well maintained. There is limited greenery in the society but beyond the boundary, there is a lot of green areas. Pets are there but very little space is available for them and you have to take it outside.Those who have not paid for the parking,park their car outside the gate.Visitors parking are there 4 or 5 slots available at one gate and 4 or 5 slots at another gate. Infrastructure is overall good like roads, streetlights etc. Good schools are nearby like Lancers International School but it is very expensive. There is only one in-house shop. If you want daily need items then you have to buy from there only, options are not available but I get it easily, which is good. There are so many good hospitals nearby like Artemis, which is 6 km, and Paras, which is 3 km. There is no public transport. Here we have one spot area nearby shop where we sit together and do gossiping. Outside the society there is not much to see.",

All the basic amenities are available like the clubhouse and swimming pool and they are functional too except for the swimming pool which got shut down since September. There\u2019s quite sufficient amount of green parks and open areas here which is adequate as per the standard area of the society. Parking is convenient for both the residents and the visitors and no such issues are faced for parking here. The quality of the roads within the society is good but the construction quality is just average due to which we tend to face a lot of seepage issues,apart from that, rest is perfect in this society and this society is quite conveniently located near my workplace.",

There\u2019s lush greenery here and sufficient green parks and open areas for towers 1-3 and each tower is facing these parks. Kids are allowed to play here and it\u2019s safe to send the kids down to play in the parks as the security is pretty good here as there are guard at each tower and even at the gates with functional 24x7 CCTV cameras so it\u2019s pretty fine here. But there\u2019re often issues in the security here as the intercom might not be working most of the times but you can\u2019t blame the security personnels for that because it\u2019s the management that should maintain and take care of such things. There are a lot of loopholes in the management here as services are not done here properly, since it\u2019s a Unitech property the construction quality is just average and you face a lot of seepage issues here and these issues are not fixed properly.Apart from that the infrastructure is still better as it\u2019s the most spacious apartment you can get at 1800sqft. Talking about amenities we have a well maintained clubhouse and sports facilities such as Basketball court and Tennis court,a swimming pool is here too but it\u2019s not yet operational for the people living here. Parking is very convenient as there\u2019s ample parking space available for the residents in the basements and ground parking space for visitors. Other than that there are 3 schools here which are within 3kms area and good markets such as Arcadia, Good Earth and McDonalds are there which are easily accessible. The good thing here is the community living which is great to a certain extent as earlier around 2yrs back there were less inhabitants in this society but now there are a lot of people here and there\u2019s great engagement by them in various events taking place here. Overall it\u2019s a very good place to live.",

So when it comes to the safety of the kids it always matters. As per the society, it is ok but there should be more greenery and open spaces. There is an extension of harmony where they have 5 towers and a big area too. I am happy with my parking as it is right front of my tower so both my cars are parked together.In one house one slot is mandatory,everything is paid here and if you want then you can take additional parking too,that is, 4 lacs to purchase the parking.The visitors' parking is very decent but the only problem here is that the residents park their cars in the visitor parking,and strict action should be taken for that.Security is good here but I feel that there are certain issues with the Unitech offices as if they are not getting the salary ideally hence they are not putting their 100% in their work. But the people of the security team are very nice. I am quite happy with the security but because they are not getting their salary on time they are not doing a good job.  Infrastructure is good but the roads are broken,the materials used are patheti, maintenance is not perfect and seepage is the only problem which is constant. People are nice though the maintenance of the park is not good.",

Once my car was stuck,then the guards helped me,also they help in crossing the roads. I am happy with the security because every person is getting the facility in terms of security as compared to the other societies in Nirvana Country. Amenities are amazing here, we have a full fledged clubhouse. and I haven't seen any society who have a squash, gym, tennis table, jogging track, lawn tennis etc. all together in one place. It's not claustrophobic at any point of time too. Maintenance of the society and its greenery is not prompt in the society,whenever we call them, they never respond on time. The maintenance team needs to be more responsible and perform well. They should behave responsibily.Space for parking is always available. The best part is that even a visitor can park their car here as there is a parking space of 35 to 38 cars here.On the whole,the construction of the building is perfect but seepage and some basic things are not good but it can be improved.",

The clubhouse is decent and the gym is the only thing that\u2019s functional also, there\u2019s no swimming pool option here. There is sufficient amount of parks for tower 1-3 but these days cleanliness issues are there since it\u2019s not well maintained. Parking is well oriented and convenient here as there are 2 car parking spaces available for residents at the basement level and ground parking spaces available for visitor parking. There are no concerns or hassles related to parking problems here. Everything here is well organised and disciplined. The infrastructure is just average here as you tend to face a lot of seepage issues which is the most common issues faced my many living here along with termite problems but the layout is pretty efficient as its spacious and luxurious and you get proper light and air,also there\u2019s much privacy here. There\u2019s convenient access to public transportation now as earlier it was a problem to get access to public transport. Markets are all nearby and very conveniently located so do the reputed hospitals such as Arthemis and Park which are closely located to this place. Also good schools like Heritage, which is one of the top 10 schools, is just nearby. Maids are easily available here as there are a lot of villages located nearby.Overall it\u2019s a beautiful community to live in.",

There is a swimming pool constructed but it is not functional and I don\u2019t think that it will ever be.The clubhouse is really nice and there is a kid\u2019s play area too.  The green and the open areas are very good in this society; we have lots of green and open areas here and they are well maintained too. They have provided us with enough parking spaces; the owners and the renters have parking spaces in both the basements and the visitors have to park outside but within the society. The infrastructure is not bad; the main issue is the water seepage. If we have any complaints regarding anything they are not responsive enough and we have to go again and again with no results. One of the good things is that all the flats are park and road facing and there are just 2 flats per floor which is an other advantage. Events are not conducted regularly which I think it is good to have regular events.The security here is very good; there are guards around 24x7 at the main gate as well as in every tower. They check the workers and if the workers are carrying any item from the apartment they are supposed to have a slip from the resident,and even that is checked thoroughly. There are intercoms, passes for the maids and other raddi walas who come into the society and all are given the passes. When there is a visitor and if we want the guard to accompany them to the apartment, they do it.  Overall, the society is small so it feels like we have a big family. I needed a secure and a good place where my son can be happy and he can play and I am satisfied with this society.",

Parking is again very good and we do not have to pay any extra charge for another parking. If you have 3 BHK then you get three parking space and same with 2 BHK. Infrastructure is fine. In some flats, there are issues with seepage but not in our flats. House cleaners are easily available here. The quality of lifts is fine and if it gets damaged then it takes 8 to 10 hours to repair. I chose this place because it is near to my office.Amenities are just average and we are not satisfied with it as the clubhouse is not fully developed, works are still pending and even the swimming pool has not started yet.

I have selected this project because of proximity from everything and space. We do have amenities but it is very average because even though the clubhouse and everything are nice their maintenance is very poor.Other than the swimming pool, everything else is there in the clubhouse. Security is good but not that much good because they do not check everyone who comes in. Sometimes people come in without checking with us which is not good and sometimes the landline is not working.

The clubhouse here is good; it has a pretty good gym and sports facilities like squash courts, TT table and lawn tennis court are available. The swimming pool is under construction; this causes problems during the rainy season as this gets filled up with water and becomes stagnant. The open and green areas are well maintained. The residents have allotted parking spaces in the basements so there is no issue with the parking facility. The infrastructure is good and so are the lifts. We also have 100% power backup.

However, coaches are available here which is good. Green and open areas are there but they do not take care of it and sometimes the parks are not even cleaned. After 9 pm some parents restrict children to play which is not good, as this is common area for everyone and due to this, our kids are not able to play in garden.Parking is good as we have two slots of parking and we have not faced any issues over it. There are no extra charges for visitor parking. Infrastructure is very poor as quality of construction is pathetic and bad which results in too many problems like seepage which is the major problem in our flats. However, streetlights are there. House cleaners are easily available. The quality of lifts is not good as whenever we want to use it it stops.The place is friendly for senior citizens.Security of Harmony is excellent, no doubts about it. Visitor and vehicle verification process happens round the clock and cameras are installed at the entrance of every tower. House cleaners are not allowed to enter the society without their passes. Even the guards do their part very efficiently which makes security of top class. We selected this place as it has three sides open and is a very decent area.",

The good hospitals are also closeby like cloud nine, medanta etc. The layout of the apartment is very good because mine is on the first floor, and we have sufficient space. It is a very peaceful and calm society.Security is excellent here and if someone comes to my house then they have to call me twice because of the tight security.People have complaints regarding this, like the security is too tight and we have to call you twice before coming to your place,but otherwise everything is good.They do verification though I don't know about CCTVs but the best part of the security is the guards, they don't let the kids out without parents' permission.",

The infrastructure is just okay here since its built by Unitech so the quality of construction is average or poor but the layout of the flats is very good as there\u2019s good ventilation and you get ample amount of sunlight.

Amenities are average as the kids play area is not much here but most of the things are not working in the clubhouse. Green and open areas are nice and well maintained and playing outdoor is allowed to the children here. Parking is normal as we have no issues regarding it and visitors are satisfied with it. Infrastructure is average as it has not been maintained well and the new towers dont have many facilities. Even they do not care about the cleaning which is disgusting. Since we moved here only one lift is working and the rest of the lifts have not been repaired till yet. Nirvana is known for its seepage.",

But still there are flaws in it as the intercoms arent working most of the times and the automatic doors in each tower are usually out of order.  There\u2019s enough amount of green parks and open areas here but these days they are not well maintained these days. The infrastructure is just fine here when compared with the price but you often face seepage issues and no proper step has been taken to resolve this issue.

Women are not safe if they move out after 9-10pm as I see guards sleeping during their duty hence are not vigilant. We have outdoor badminton, tennis, and basketball (half court) and we have swimming pools and gym within the club. Everything here is very clean and they maintain it very well. The space provided is amazing. Events for festivals like Dusshrea, Diwali and even Dandiya nights are organized here. Even Diwali poojas are organized inside the campus, but for bursting fireworks during Diwali we have to go outside. We do face a bit of electricity problem because of power cuts. Parking is a problem here because people at times park anywhere and they have to be asked by the guards to remove the car from there. There are issues with the lifts too; I myself got stuck for about 15 minutes once. We have just 1 resident lift and 1 service lift. But everything else is very good. It is a friendly and an amazing society with big open spaces.",

The gym is not that good; there should be more equipment. We are not allowed to play cricket or football inside, but there are cricket nets plus they have provided a space outside the society to play. Electricity and water supply is available 24x7. Visitor parking is not there and they are told to park outside the society. Each resident is provided with two parking spaces. The rooms are not that spacious, they are small in size. There is a lot of traffic outside the society which causes noise and air pollution. The street lights are pretty fine. The lift of tower C is not at all good, if 1 lift is working then the other one stops and they are very small too; if someone is shifting it is very hard to move the luggage, etc.",

Greenery is good according to me. There is no proper waste management and abundant use of plastic bags. Because this is a big society and educated people live here hence they should minimize the usage of plastic bags. Festivals are organized but not that much. I am not happy with the maintenance as I have complained about leakages from pipes because of which it is easier for mosquitoes to breed. Cleanliness is good but please give attention to seepage problem too.",

Sports facilities are there. Drainage and seepage system is an issue in the bathroom. Construction quality is not good. I personally like the open space, proper ventilation, lots of light and ample space to roam inside the society. Parking is fine, there are 2 parking per flat, one in the basement and one in the open. So even if a visitor comes he can park the car very easily.",

Every area or block has 2-3 dustbins aligned to dispose waste that I haven't seen in Delhi where I stay. Finding autos and sometimes cabs to come here is a problem at times,also when I have to head back home with my 2 year old kid,the transportation is not easily available. Rest is OK altogether.",

There are separate rooms to play caroms, cards, billiards and there is an indoor badminton court and an outdoor lawn tennis court. There is a good kid\u2019s play area too. We have about 4 parks which are big enough. They are well maintained so kids can play anything they like here. The security is good too; there are good guards 24x7. There are CCTV cameras installed but I don\u2019t think they are functional. There are passes for the maids, intercoms for communication between the guards and the residents and there are stickers for the cars. They provide the residents with 2 allotted parking spaces; one covered and the other open, which is enough. But the only problem is that it is not allotted in such a way that it is near to your tower; our parking is very far from our tower so we have to walk a lot to get to our car. There are separate covered and open parking spaces for the visitors within the society. The construction quality is better than the other societies but there are people who keep cribbing about it. There are a little seepage issues now. There are in house grocery stores. We have 100% power backup. Good events are celebrated in the society.",

Passes are provided to all housemaids and are checked before they enter the main gate. Intercoms are provided in all flats so that if any visitor comes then guards first call the resident,get confirmation from them and then direct them to the respective flat. Seepage problem is there and raw materials used while construction are so bad that they have worn out. The clubhouse is good and clean but I find it small as in if I need to hold some kind of function or reception sort of thing ,I cannot hold that, even though this community is good otherwise in celebrating every festival here.Maintenance is a slight issue here,as they delay our work ,for example, last weekend I faced a trip in electricity and it was sorted this Tuesday because there are very less maintenance staff in the society.",

The parks have a kid\u2019s play area, a lot of open areas which are pretty much friendly for the pets as well. The security is better than other independent houses, CCTV cameras are there, guards are always safeguarding the society. The infrastructure quality is just fine and average just like the other builders, but the layout is pretty nice and efficient.  The parking is well organised here as every resident has got both covered and open parking and even visitor parking is available inside the society. The society is really good for senior citizens as they have put benches and chairs for them. We have an ATM store, convenience store, a petrol pump just few minutes away and good hospitals like Arthemis is very close. The place is well located next Golf Course road extension. The community living is pretty nice as the gentry is quite good as there\u2019s a mix of all working class from middle to high class people. It\u2019s a very good place to stay because of its layout, the budget and because of its location.",

There is a tennis court, basketball court and a badminton court. There is a kids play area too which is very well maintained. There are about 5 parks and all the parks are well maintained but I would want more trees to be planted within the society. The security is good.We have a three tier security system; checking at the main gate, intercom and security at each tower too. There are CCTV cameras and passes for the maids without which they cannot enter the society. The parking facility is excellent; there are 2 parking spaces allotted for each flat; one covered parking and the other on the ground level. There is a separate parking space for the visitors too. There hasn\u2019t been any problem regarding the infrastructure of the society so far. We have in house stores to get groceries. The quality of the lifts is excellent. There are ramps for the senior citizens so I can say that it is senior citizen friendly. This society is basically for families so bachelors are not allowed. Regular events are conducted during all the festivals and they are pretty good too.",

The parks and clubs inside are very good, clean, maintained properly. Roads inside are good.In the basement parking there is some seepage problem. During the rainy season the basement gets flooded and residents are not able to go down to get their own private vehicles, the basement itself gets drenched completely during rains. On ground level everything is very neat and clean, dusting is done on a daily basis so no problem on that front. Speaking about markets, I haven't seen much though as it is on the main road, only Boom Plaza and few shops are available.",

Safety wise it is pretty good. The only problem I found is regarding maintenance and roads. The apartments are not whitewashed well, the paint has worn out which doesn't look good.

RWA is doing all that on our cost as we have given 60 thousand to the RWA for maintenance. The interior layout of the apartments is pretty good but as compared to this ,the exterior layout is not that good. There are no street lights outside the society so I always find difficulties at night while crossing the roads. Even the roads are in bad condition, but the RWA is taking pains to fix them. There is a park in the society. The safety and  security of the society is also fine. We have separate club in the club house for senior citizen, and I go there daily.",

In our society,no incident has happened related to security and as I live alone it becomes important to me that the security be really good. Kids are there and no one stops them from playing so there are no complaints against them. Parking is excellent,for two cars parking slots are provided and for the third car you have to park that outside.Visitors parking is outside but if somebody is coming for a short duration,then they can park inside. So it is not an issue, that is flexible actually. Everything is available here in terms of amenities, which is perfect like a gym, spa, swimming pool, a game and lot of things. In sports, we enjoy table tennis, indoor games, billiard etc. Seepage is there but they are maintaining that. Inside the society we have Kidzee School, the market and stores are there with the ATM. We have never faced any electricity problem because of power backup. Senior citizens have a group where they even have a laughter club where my dadu also goes.They provide trips also for the senior citizens.There is no problem with the pets and they can roam around freely.",

Visitor parking is in the basement and resident parking is defined and not too many people are living here so parking is no problem. Building construction is average street light and roads are ok except that some part of the project is under construction so that also a problem sometimes but atleast constructed part street light is fine but construction quality is not good. The only thing is the under construction is part of this society so that sometimes it lay down otherwise it is all ok. And the construction quality definitely is not good or up to the mark.Th security is good.They overdo it sometimes.When visitor comes, they get the entry done but they don't call but otherwise, it is overall good.

There aren\u2019t sufficient green and open areas here since it\u2019s developing and almost everyone is using the one single park which makes it a bit congested. Apart from that there is no clubhouse facility which is really required and there\u2019s no proper sports facility also here. The inside layout of the apartments is fine and it still needs some improvement but the construction quality of these apartments are very poor. Parking is convenient here and there\u2019s no hassle with visitor parking as well as there\u2019s sufficient space available for parking.The only problem faced here is that there are no markets closeby and this place lacks basic amenities, apart from these issues,the location of this place is the best and is away from traffic hustle and pollution.

Apart from that there are sufficient open and green areas here especially for the Tower D3 and D4 and these places are always maintained well and are clean most of the times. Parking is not an issue here, every flat has been allotted with proper parking space and there\u2019s no problem faced here by the visitors for their parking as well. The overall quality of the infrastructure is very poor and it was not something expected based on the investment we had made in this place. The place is ideal for the working class people as Sohna Road is becoming the next corporate hub after Cyber City, so this place is suitably priced for tenants and at least 50% community living here are tenants. Though the construction quality is poor here but nevertheless it\u2019s a liveable place.Since it\u2019s a Unitech property the security is around 24x7 and it\u2019s quite decent but overall it\u2019s not that good.Since in this place only 6-7 towers are operational, so when once the society is well established there will be improvements in the security as well.",

The visitors don\u2019t have any separate space for parking; they use the parking spaces given to the residents as of now as all the flats are not occupied. We have very good security; the number of guards are good and they are dedicated to their job. Even though there is nothing techy for security, there are tags for the visitors, passes for the maids and intercoms but they are not functional. The infrastructure is good from a tenant\u2019s perspective but it is bad from an owner\u2019s perspective. A small drill on the walls causes the plaster to come off with the cement. There are in house stores to get basic need items. We have stretcher lifts here which is a good thing and the quality if the lifts are also good. This society is very new and the people here are great and cooperative. We also conduct events regularly and especially during festivals which increases the bond between the residents.",

There is only a small room available which are used by aunties for kirtan and sometimes, in winters, the dogs are there in that room. There are no CCTVs here except on the main gate. There used to be a guard at every tower initially but now they are not there, street dogs also enter the society due to this problem.There is a playground for kids and swings are there but society people manage it,we collected the money and put swings and slides in the park. Unitech provides only badminton and volleyball court. The under construction area have no greenery only D1 D2 area have greenery, parks & all but not full campus. For resident parking, two parking spaces are available for everybody. For visitor, you have to park that in your parking slots. Infrastructure is not good. Construction is very poor there is nothing to connect with the main road. The main road is too far away from the society. If you have a personal vehicle then it is ok but if you don't ,then there is a problem. Millennium, Global, Amity schools are nearby. Medanta's is close, within 5 km, so many hospitals are there.",

In the name of amenities, we have only a kids play area, which the residents have made by contributing for the swings. Swings are not safe as their quality is cheap. We live in B block, that is in under construction and we do not have any park or open area so we have to go D block which has an open area. However, there is no maintenance of parks. Parking is pathetic as my parking is in basement. They purposely punctured my car, which is disgusting and not tolerable. Infrastructure is average as construction material is not of good quality but roads are approachable and till now we could not find any seepage in our flats. Earlier the quality of lifts was not good but now it is getting better. We selected this place as my children's school is near to this place.

Therefore, amenities are poor for us. There are 16 to 20 towers in which 7 or 8 are operational and they have only three green areas which is comparatively a less number. Therefore, it is ok for morning walk and landscaping is good. For now, parking is very good as this society has not been fully occupied and there are many empty spaces where we can park. However, it might be a problem in future. Infrastructure is poor as construction and maintenance quality is very bad. Every Unitech has seepage issue and they would not correct it yet. House cleaners are easily available. The quality of lifts is very pathetic,it stops anytime whenever they want and it's renewable time has expired.RWA is not active and builder does not work properly as we were supposed to get this flat by 2011 but it got delayed and finally we got this flat last year. Our stay here so far has been dissatisfying, as the property did not live up to our expectations based on the investment we made in it.",

They didn't utilize the space in a proper manner actually. The material , quality of construction is poor,we can't even put a nail on the wall. If you will do so, then the entire structure falls down. The kind of material or bricks are used is very poor lots of seepage problem which have come up. Last year in November, we shifted here and this problem is in every flat in the society. Workmanship is very poor.\u00a0Security is not so good here. The guards are not skilled enough to manage the things so we have seen many time peoples come upstairs and their credentials are not checked,though we have an intercom facility.Though they are improving slowly but I think it will take time. In terms of kids' play area we have only a park, swings and slides in front of these towers and not all over the premises of the society.Here,this is the only playgroup area the kids have right now for so many families together.Clubhouse is in under construction,though they promised for a clubhouse swimming pool and everything else inside the premises only. Open spaces are ok,landscaping is all right. Greenery is maintained well,we have seen the gardener working on that, trimming the grasses and all. Parking is also ok because every resident has their designated parking slots. So we have to park our car there only,we also have basement parking facility. Residents have parking stickers. Two parking spaces are available in the society. Infrastructure is very poor because of the route inside,so builders not able to give the proper route, which is so far from the main road. Schools buses come there only,the lane is very narrow though. I think the builder didn't decide upon the connecting road. They just made the towers and then they later decided to find a route, which is a very sorry condition. Good schools are there like G D Goenka,which is ok. Market ok the ILD is there at the walking distance it's ok. Malls are nearby and we have our own grocery store so we get everything nearby. The hospital is also nearby like Medicity,Artemis and Park hospitals so we have good hospitals around.",

The construction quality is poor here, if we put a nail on the wall it makes a big hole on the wall and because of that our paintings or photos come down from the walls quite very often.Around 1 month ago an incident happened where the wall of a flat just came down during the evening around 6 but luckily no one got hurt.There are no amenities here like a clubhouse which is yet to be constructed. The clubhouse is essential in this society because we are not able to organise birthday parties and other functions,we host such celebrations in our flat and there is not much space inside the flats which becomes a constraint for us and a problem faced by most of the people here. Apart from that we have quitea lot of green and open areas here which is clean most of the times. There\u2019s a space which is used as court to play badminton and volleyball,and a separate space is utilised for skating facility,also we have hired a skating trainer who comes to train students and this is organised by the people living in this society. Security is good here as you have guards at the gates and even at each tower and proper measures are taken, earlier we had issues with the security but now it\u2019s being improved. Parking is very convenient here as every flat has been allotted with 2 parking space: - one open and the other in basement and there\u2019s no problem with visitor parking here as well as there\u2019s enough space available here for parking. There are a lot of good schools like Amity, GD Goenka and Ryan International nearby. We also have a lot of malls nearby but we don\u2019t get all our items from there,like for basic stationary items we have to drive down to the local markets as there are no markets here in this area. \u00a0But the locality is quite good and maids are easily available here but they are fussy sometimes. \u00a0Overall it\u2019s a good place to live with good community living.",

If you are above 36 years old or if you have a kid so it is fine, but not for younger couples.M2K security is average.There is no problem as such but I used to stay in Belvedere Tower previously and there if someone came to visit our house then they never let anybody enter the premises until and unless the guards gave us a call and checked with us whether the person is genuine or not. As compared to that anybody can walk up here anytime and without any reason. There are no CCTVs in the society; people have their own CCTV. In terms of amenities, nothing is available as such. They just have a park but not exactly a park but empty plots. Swing and slides are there are for the kids but that is not up to the mark and there is no garden even. Greenery is there and it is maintained. There are no open spaces as such, limited open space is there and kids are allowed to play.Neither there are pets nor is there a poop area in the society. People park anywhere, there is a confined parking for the people staying in the society,apart from that they park their car behind another car.From the infrastructure point of view everything is good ,only the layout of the apartment is pretty good but the kitchen is small otherwise the apartment is spacious. We shifted here one and half months back so we do not know about electricity and water supply as such.",

I moved to Gurgaon in 2013 and safety was a major concern for me but here I see that the society security is pretty good. We have CCTV cameras, guards and no one can come inside without calling(including the delivery boys). There is a clubhouse, kids play area, and sports facilities but the area is very congested and the society area is not that big. There are not enough greenery and open spaces.Well maintained greenery is there for kids with a swimming pool and also one small park where they can play,but there is nothing for senior citizens. Overall the infrastructure is good like the roads, streetlights and building construction. The society has a shop otherwise there are no options for shopping. Either you can shop from in-house or you can order from the big basket. Metro station is nearby and the society's location is pretty good, but DLF Phase 3 it is not a residential area. It is kind of official area, where you cannot find any place to roam around or for entertainment.",

There were no children of his age group to play there,and now he has other children also to play with and he has several facilities where he can play badminton or football and  sometimes basketball, everything will help in the development of my son. That is the one reason we selected this place.I like the security of the society basically, because they take care of every person who comes inside the society and they take care of any courier etc. There are two-security check one at the main gate and one at the tower. In sports, we have everything like badminton, tennis, swimming, skating, football, basketball, cricket you name it and they have it. For kids swings are there;every facility we have for kids. Greenery is there and maintained very well and I have seen people who have pets so they are allowed but for poop, they have to take them outside. We have one parking and C tower has space for visitors parking. Everything in infrastructure is good.",

We have a pet and so we have lots of restrictions, we have to take our pet outside for walk.Parking is not too convenient; we have to walk a bit of a distance, so they didn't plan it close to the apartment. Visitors have five or ten spaces for parking but very limited space is available. Roads and streetlight are good and overall infrastructure is average. For market, I have to drive a few km. The nearest one is Medanta but I don't think any good hospitals are nearby.Water supply is regular but not clean.It helps people in safety. If one sees the guards, people get alerted. But the guard do not do much. There is less verification. There are various people who get inside without any information. In addition, CCTV cameras are there but I don't know if someone is there to check it or not. It does feel safe here, but there is some better job they should do. Again not all the facilities are there but the maintenance of the facilities is that great. I think it is common for Gurgaon apartment. Kids play area is pretty good alongwith the gym, sports facilities again it's reasonably better than other place but the maintenance of gym is not that great. It's been only one month in this society we faced a challenge with maids but we managed anyways. They demand very high prices I don't think they have regulated prices but again the quality is not good. I think that as this is a relatively new project so you would find the things in the house relatively newer but the price point is another good reason if you go towards Golf Course.",

There is a dedicated visitors parking near D block, so if any visitor comes then they park their car there otherwise outside the society we have space for parking and this is not a big society that you can't walk to your respective house. Infrastructure is good. We have an in-house shop so we get daily need items easily. Security is very good, and the guards of this society are very nice. All the security procedure is followed by them like verification and all. There are no issues in the security. In the clubhouse there are some facilities are available and some are not it need some improvement. We have all the sports facilities.",

The security here is very good and effective as there are guards at each gate and even in each tower. New and latest security technologies are used and proper security checks are done every time.The amenities are amazing here as we have a restaurant inside the society,an operational clubhouse which is good,a gym and swimming pool,kids play area and all sports facility.Also, the parks and green areas here are sufficient. Since it's a new society parking is very convenient here, generally every flat has been allotted with 2 car parking space but it depends on the owner on how much parking space he/she requires, visitor parking option is available both inside and outside the society. The overall infrastructure is very good here as there is good air ventilation, proper and efficient layout with privacy and good construction quality.The place is conveniently located with all the schools and hospitals but there's no market within a 2km area from here so we always have to drive to the nearest market to get our basic things.24x7 electricity and water supply is provided. Bestech Park View Spa Next is overall a great society to live in with good facilities.",

Security is very good here and that was the main reason why we chose this society because the security here is very efficient and effective. Guards are well trained and there's intercom and CCTV's as well in this society. Parking is quite convenient for us and there is no problem for the visitors as well which is really convenient. The roads inside the society are really good but the construction quality is not that good for example,when we put a nail in the wall then wall comes down or the cement chips away.The quality of lifts is fine and its functional most of the times. We have got a lot of stores within the society where we get our daily things very easily, markets are coming up next to our locality but there are malls just a drive away,good hospitals are a bit far away from here.We do get 24x7 electricity with 100% power backup, regular supply of water and as well as maids very easily.",

Before someone gets into the colony,they make two calls, one at the main gate and near each tower.Intercom facility is available and in that way, it is much safer, security wise it is good, when first time we had to get into the society we had to go to the same procedure and we thought that it is a well-secured place. Actually in the clubhouse we now have a swimming pool, gym, and party hall, you can get other groceries, fresh fruits, vegetables too,so there is no need to go outside the society and we also havea snack store. We have two kids play areas and we have a badminton court, volleyball court, tennis, basketball court etc. Parking is good actually, we have two parking slots so we never felt any problem in that and visitor parking is good and dedicated visitor parking is there. If someone has more than two cars then you can request any of your friends otherwise, you have to park it outside. Overall infrastructure is pretty good. Markets are there but a bit far off since we have it inside so we do not find it very difficult.Housemaids are easily available and their prices are ok not very expensive and all they keep doing bhajans and all. I selected this project because its close to my daughter's school and we liked it too.The main thing is that they do have programs like cultural events with all the other facilities, grocery items and everything which you get it here only you don't have to go out. Children also have nice amenities we don't have to worry at all and that's what we like about this society.",

It is a peaceful area, we wanted to away from the crowd since Gurgaon is very crowded and very polluted. This is one place where we find peace as it is quite far from the main Gurgaon just for peace and greenery that is one reason we are here. Security wise it is very good because my son roams around here and there and I don't have to worry at all. Sometimes he is in the basement sometimes he is in the park and everybody knows him so don't have to worry. The guards are very good; they maintain all the verification like maid verification and visitor verification. Amenities are nice as we have got a restaurant, banquet hall for the parties, gym, basement party and festivals we have it here. For kids, there are skating activities, basketball, tennis, almost all the facilities we have. There is a lot of greenery in the society and it is maintained very well. Kids always play in the park they hardly go to the basketball court or any other place because the adults don't allow the teenagers. There is an ample parking where everybody is assigned a parking so we park our car in our own spaces. Visitors parking are one in D block, one is outside so no issues in parking, and overall infrastructure is good.",

There are 2 big parks and a lot of greenery.Visitor parking is not well managed.There should be a separate visitor parking in front of every tower. But here we don't get to see anything of that sort. Street lights don't work. Roads are also not maintained. The only negative about this project is that it is deserted and quite alone from the major market and commercial area. Infrastructure wise it is very good.",

Sometimes there is a technical problem in the gym but they do repair it as soon as possible. For kids there are some swings and some activities like guitar, only you have to pay for them. We have sports facilities also like badminton court, tennis, cricket etc. I am happy with the greenery and their maintenance. Pets are not allowed to poop in the society they have to go outside the society. The parking is very good for the residents and even for visitor parking, there are no issues.

The place is very good for senior citizens as they have proper benches and ramps installed in the society. Th negative thing here is the infrastructure,though the layout is pretty efficient with spacious rooms but the quality of the walls are not good  and they often come out and there's really less number of switchboards in the living room area.  The security here,so far,is pretty awesome as we haven't faced any issues till now and it's safe to send the kids down to play as the whole society is safe and secure.Parking is very convenient here as every flat has been alloted with proper parking space, and the visitor parking is also much disciplined here.  There's a primary school within the society by the name of Alpine,apart from that there's St.Xavier's which is within 2kms radius. There's in-house grocery shop and vegetable store where we get all the day-to-day items quite easily.We get 24x7 electricity with 100% power backup and regular water supply in terms of amenities.Apart from that there's a clubhouse which has a gym and swimming pool and kids play area in the parks here. The parks are quite sufficient and so are the open areas where even pets are allowed to stroll. The housewives here in this society have setup hobby classes like:- cooking and drawing which makes the people here quite engaged and active which makes this place an enjoyable place to live.",

The security here is very good as the guards are always alert, vigilant and they take the security pretty seriously and they don't even allow the kids to go out even with the maids without getting a proper written letter and a call of confirmation from the resident/parents.We just moved into this society two years ago from DLF phase 5 and have realised that the amenities here are excellent as there\ufffds a clubhouse with gym, trainers.Coaches are provided for skating and cricket games.Inside the clubhouse we have indoor games like foosball and snooker, there are plenty of stores inside the society where you get all your items,right from stationery to vegetables and other needful things. Parking is quite convenient here as every resident has got 2 parking space and they need to pay extra to get one more space. There are plenty of parks and open areas and a separate area for the pets. The infrastructure within the society is good in-terms of roads and buildings. The flooring is poor but the rooms are quite spacious and there's optimal utilization of space,efforts are being taken in order to improve the condition of the roads outside the society.There are plenty of schools within this locality like: Lotus Valley, Manav Rachna and St.Xaviers.The engagement from the residents here is pretty good as they participate actively in all festive events celebrated in this society. Overall it's a very good place to live.",

The layout is pretty amazing with spacious 3 bedroom flats. The infrastructure here is pretty well maintained and there are 2 elevators per building and they are always operational. There's sufficient amount of greenery here with a lot of parks and ample amount of open areas, the parks are often maintained well and there's a certain place for the kids to play as well also there's a skating rink, basketball court and lawn tennis court which are available here in terms of sports facilities.Also there's a clubhouse which has a gym, restaurants and swimming pool.There are several grocery stores, vegetable stores , saloon and dry cleaners which is quite helpful for us. The security is pretty excellent with a guard in each tower.It's a gated community where an account of all the people coming and going is kept.No one is allowed to enter without getting the confirmation from the residents, even the maids have been given ID cards and are not allowed to enter without that. Parking is decent and disciplined here as there's a reserved parking space for the residents and a separate place allotted for visitor parking.The community living here is great as all the residents are very social and active here and there are a lot of activities and events going on all the time with a lot of engagement done by the residents here. This place is very good for senior citizens as well as they have separate area in the clubhouse. There are some schools around the place and plenty of malls in Sohna Road, maids are easily available here but the cost is quite expensive. Apart from that we get 24x7 electricity and water with 100% power backup feature as well. And the clubhouse is fine though but it could have been a bit bigger in terms of size. Overall it's a pretty good place to live with family.",

Main road pollution is not there as the society is not directly on the main road. Club house and the swimming pool are good.

There are a lot of open spaces inside the project while other societies seem congested,for example,during Diwali festival, events are organized and we have over 76 stalls plus a gathering of more than 300 people and still there is room for more. RWA has been active, cultural events have improved. Yoga sessions, meditation and physio sessions are available within the society.We have an NGO operated by women,who educate the children of workers, which is a very good initiative. They give tuitions to the children in the evening. Access from the main road is easy. There are 3 gates. Clubhouse is still with the builder, so that issue has been going on. However, there is a gym, swimming pools, kids play areas and they enjoy as well. Security is good, fingerprint system is installed for better security. There is separate parking for visitors. There is strictness for the unauthorized parking. Supermarket, grocery shop and movie hall is conveniently located. Roads are good and overall maintenance is good. Good activities for children like tennis and cricket are held.Run initiatives have created a really nice atmosphere here.Festivals like holi/ diwali/ dandiya/ christmas are celebrated really well here.Big TV screens are installed during world cup. Its a senior-citizen friendly society as they get together and go for picnics.Old age people as well as the young also take active part in all activities. Also, bhajans are held in the evenings. Cleanliness and hygiene are taken care of in the society.",

The construction quality of the flats here is very poor but the RWA is doing an excellent job in maintaining the infrastructure. The security is excellent here in Orchid Petals as there are over 250 active security personnels here and proper security procedures such as fingerprint sensor and RFID car sensors are used, there are 24x7 CCTV cameras which make it a safe and secure place to stay. There are enough open and green areas which is really good as they are always clean and very well maintained and even a kids play area is there. Parking is by far efficient here as every flat has got 2 parking spaces allotted and even visitor parking space is easily available here. The club house is not that good but other amenities such as electricity and water supply are really good. There are reputed hospitals and markets like Sapphire market which is just a walk away from our place which is highly convenient for us as we get all our items very easily. The neighbours living here are very good but this is not place to own an apartment because of its poor condition but apart from this place as mentioned before its a great place to live in Gurgaon.",

In infrastructure streetlights are good and roads are good but if you talk about apartment the quality of material is not good, finishing is also not good sometimes flush is not working here so no proper drainage is there in the balcony.Seepage problem is there.Space wise it is very good,apartment layout in terms of size and in terms of design is fine too.But there is no proper finishing in the apartment,lobby tiles are also not in symmetry.We have an in-house shop but they are expensive,a small garden is there but is not well maintained. Greenery is there open space is there greenery is well maintained. Parking is good enough and is available on the road.  Roads are broad enough but after some time if any person has more than one or two cars then it will look messy. Visitor parking is also good. Only one car-parking slot is allotted.

There\u2019s an underground parking available for residents and 1 space has been given per flat,plus they have an option to have one more but you have to pay for that, and much open spaces are there for visitor parking. The construction quality is pretty decent here and it\u2019s much better than the other builder properties with reputed names.Since the locality is developing here, in the next one year we\u2019ll have schools , markets and hospitals close to our place but still this place is worth the budget and a good area to live in.",

It is a society so amenities are too less like no clubhouse and sports facility are available, only one kids play area is there. Green and open areas are average as only two parks are available but gardeners take care of it. Children are allowed to play in those parks.Parking is sufficient for visitors as well as for residents as we have open parking space. Infrastructure is fine only as roads have patches that they rarely consider mending. Seepage issue is not a big problem but sometimes it is. Streetlights are enough in number.

There are too many cars and then barely have a visitors parking available. There is no proper record, no proper upkeep. And as far as the infrastructure is concerned then the houses itself they are so old 12 years old, even they were new they won't that good because there was a lot of leakages and everything. Like Unitech doesn't make good houses. More like the builders don't know how to make the houses. All the houses are facing the same problem as if the interconnecting pipes they were either broken or they were not a good quality from the beginning itself.",

Therefore, it is good. There are four parks. Our block is very green and well maintained as our gardeners are there to look after them. Parking is good as open parking space is present, usually one space is provided but we can park more than one if the space is vacant. Visitors parking issues exist here. In infrastructure, everything is fine except seepage due to old construction or use of poor material. There is no backup for electricity but they are planning for backup installation. Housemaids are easily available at economical rates. This place is senior citizen friendly. During heavy rains, water logging becomes the most annoying thing to deal with.

It was not specified to any block. I love the greenery of C Block there are a lot of trees and there is green in the park.Even outside the park, there are a lot of greenery there is a snake in the park, and there is peacock too. This society is quite secure,usually they check maids and all that stuff whether they are verified by somebody or if they are carrying, some kind of stuff.If some unknown vehicle comes they usually stop them.They had also provided car stickers for the resident's cars. There is no CCTV within the society. There is a park, which is fine as there are three parks in C Block. In terms of clubs, there is a common club, which is there that is the Patio club, but I have not used it, so I do not know how good it is. For kids things are fine they have different kind of rides, swings. I can say that from kid's point of view that it is fine, from an adult point of view I do not know.  The maintenance of the society is quite good for our pocket. RWA are also doing their job in a proper manner. There is ample parking because the parks are there so everyone parks their car around that park as well so; it increases the number of parking. There is no allocated parking but there is a space for parking. I have one allotted slot for parking. Overall infrastructure of the society is very good and not the best because there is lots of construction going on.Electricity is not that good within the society because it is not society provided electricity and we have our own inverter and all.This society is the best as we have never faced any problem from last 3 years. Usually, the senior citizens have their informal group where they use the park during the festivals also; they collect the money and do get together.",

Amenities are good here and there are lots of open areas and sports facilities for the kids. Every block has a green area and there is a central park with playing area facility,with a running track. Every block has 12-18 feet wide roads for the residents and each house has been allotted with 3-4 parking slots.Infrastructure is good except the roads whose condition deteriorates in the rainy season.Housemaids are easily available so no problem on that front. Lifts are available in most houses except in a few low and mid rise towers.But the locality is very friendly for the senior citizens,kids and bachelors as well.",

No amenities are there either for children or for senior citizens.Parks and greenery is there but they are not well maintained. Parking is also an issue here. Also, roads are not good. Apart from this, small schools are here. Also, markets are at a walking distance for our basic needs to satisfy. Public transport is accessible but is found around half kilometer away.

The good hospitals are located within the radius of two kms. There is no power backup so we use our own invertorsThis place is not as friendly for senior citizens as we hoped it to be although it is friendly for pets.",

Infrastructure like roads and streets are still in developing phase so it is average. Quite a few schools are present here and market place is also present nearby.

The maintenance guys are really hard to get especially during festive season. The roads are in a poor condition as there's lot of houses been constructed so it damages the roads. Its difficult to get adjust with the people living in this society. Apart from these problems rest is very fine in this society.",

It depends upon the number of guards,the guards are attentive but they should be more attentive. No clubhouse or kids play area there so I would give it zero points.Greenery in the society is more than enough. They are maintaining the greenery very well. We have four parks in the society which are maintained and are good. Parking is very convenient, separate parking is there but not outside the house. We have open spaces in the society where we park our cars. I cannot say about the quality of construction though. Streetlights are there but sometimes they dont work as maintenance within the society is not that good.Water supply is regular but the water is a bit hard. Society is senior citizen, pet, and bachelor's friendly. I selected this project because the location is amazing; greenery is superb and its not crowded,plus we have low rise buildings here.We also have many peacocks in the society. It is a very different sort of society and looks like an American society.",

There is no power backup so we have our own invertors.Security is good here as vehicle and visitor verification, cameras and guards are there and house cleaners are not allowed to enter without their respective IDs. Every parameter is taken care of but they are not much efficient which makes the security imperfect. Only one huge park is there in the name of amenities rest all the things are lacking here, as we have no clubhouse or sports facility to use. One badminton court is there to play though and green and open areas are good but they can do better. They are well maintained as gardeners do take care of it nicely.House cleaners are easily available.There is no lift here as we have bungalows. This project is friendly for senior citizens and pets. We selected this project, as there is more open and green areas as compared to other societies and the location is convenient.",

Streetlights are there but due to construction,the roads are damaged. Some houses on ground floors are facing the issue of seepage. Housemaids are easily available. There are no lifts in this society and no maintenance staff or facilities are present, we have to call them personally. One grocery shop is there.

They have made the parks and maintained. They are improving a bit now. Parking is not a problem in some houses in seepage; some houses there are blockages and sewages. We do not have society power backup we do have our own system for power cuts. They have some separate gene set for water supply. Senior citizen friendly is there.

It is very convenient. Security is good we have CCTV's Cameras installed everywhere and the guards are working very well. There are actually two gates for both exit and entry because of security reason if you have different gates than more guards will be required, the fees and all will increased. In sports, we have a playground where children can play football otherwise nothing is there in terms of amenities. The area is quite clean and it really maintained security guards are working. Greenery is there, open spaces are there children can play. You cannot say it is too much congested. Resident parking is good for the visitors parking is outside the gate streetlight are good but basically in rainy season roads are not good drainage problem is there. The shortage is also there cut is also there for 1 to 2 hrs. The society is senior citizen friendly but most of the families living there is a nuclear family. The society is pet-friendly.",

Amenities are decent because it is there but its chargeable and not complementary for everybody(it is only complementary only for towers not for the floors). In terms of greenery and open spaces, it is excellent because lots of open spaces are there so no issues from the parking perspective because they have quite wide roads but yes,the parking is on the road for the floors at least but we have not faced any problem in parking. Many times the streetlights are not working or they are not switched on.At some time roads are maintained but not throughout the year, most of the time you see potholes and stuff like that. We face water problem in the summer season.",

Roads are good in some places and some places its rough same in the case of street lights also. There no good schools nearby these are situated in quite a distance from here. Hospitals are present and are easily accessible, market place is the talking point of this place everything is available containing some good restaurants and grocery shops.

There are no private amenities here. Kids have a park with swings to play. Enough greenery is there and is very well maintained. There is a common school in Sec 17. In the evening, when the school is vacant or there are no one in the school,kids go there and play.MNCs like Coca-Cola and Bata maintain that school.Parking is a challenge as there is no private space for every house where we can park our car. It is always problem; people have four to five cars so it is a challenge for people to park their car. They park it on roads, and roads are blocked due to those cars. The roads are good and broad,rest all is good. Only parking is the problem. There is no electricity supply from government 24*7 we have our own backup. Power cuts are there compared to Delhi.",

Guards are there but they are sleeping most of the time and are not much attentive. Maid verification process is the only thing which is fine here in security aspect. Amenities are average.Green and open space is available and is maintained well. Childrens are also allowed to play outdoor games. All the apartments are low-rise so parking never becomes an issue here. It is easy to manage. Infrastructure is good and we have not faced any issue with it. However, sometimes heavy rains cause water logging but it takes only 3 to 4 hours to clear out. There is no power backup and pets are also not allowed here. House cleaners are easily available at a nominal cost. This is not a friendly place for senior citizens and bachelors. I had selected this place as it falls within my budget plus it is more spacious, pollution is also less here as compared to Delhi.",

Parking is open for everyone as there is no security hence making it risky to park. Schools are located at some distance from the hospitals.

Talking about the security, it is poor, no proper verification is done for the trespassers, anyone can enter in the society and security should be improved which is the most important part. Roads are not maintained inside the society. In my memory, no clubhouse was ever made and no proper amenities are there. No parking slots are there, people park their vehicles outside the house which sometimes leads to road blockage. Also for the people who travel by public transport like autos, buses, it is not available on walking distance. Electricity is never an issue as proper backup is provided. Last, it is an affordable society for new employees.",

Parks are there where much greenery is there with a lawn in front of our house. It is very well maintained it is neat and clean compared to Delhi. There is a lot of open space for parking so I have never faced any problem. I have never seen any corruption over here.It is a safe locality, security is good most of the time we keep our house open but nothing has happened till now so it is good and safe.

There\u2019s a convenient store located close to our place wherein we get all our daily items. We get regular water supply but the electricity is not 24x7 as there\u2019s frequent power cuts.  Security is quite good as there are guards patrolling every time and there\u2019s CCTV here but I am not sure if it is operational. There around 2 parks here which is quite well maintained, but the roads here are poor as their condition are bad and which needs maintenance, apart  from that street lights are always functional. There\u2019s ample open space available for parking for both residents and visitors. Housemaids are easily available but they come out a bit expensive. Overall it\u2019s a very good locality to be in due to its location.",

Basic amenities like kids play area, parks ,and especially playgrounds are not there so as a sports person I really miss these facilities. Parking is open so there is ample space for all,no problems with it but we have to park it in open so security is an issue as I mentioned earlier that there are no guards . Conditions of the roads are really very bad particularly in the rainy season and there is no proper sewage system too. Schools and market are situated closely and hospitals are also there.Public transports are available, water is clean and there is not much issue of electricity.

Coming to security, proper verification is done at the gate. We have passes for maids and vendors. Also, the sticker method is there to differentiate between the visitor and resident. Parks are there, few playgrounds are also present here, greenery is ample and not an issue. Schools are there but at a good distance from the society. Daily need items are available nearby, public transport is frequently available. I never faced any issues in water supply. Also, there is a small hospital nearby.

In the clubhouse, we have a community center where all the kids of sector 40 can play. Sports facilities are not that much but if you have a football then you can play in the ground.Greenery is there in the society and is pretty well maintained too. I have seen room for improvements because they are maintaining it time to time. Some buildings have parking, rest of them have roads for parking. There is a common parking for everyone too. Streetlights are in adequate number but sometimes they are not switched on. Roads are not maintained and during the rainy season, you have knee height water on the main road street.We have Medanta and Fortis hospitals nearby.There is no 24*7 electricity,only power backup, so most of the time at least two or three hours during the winter season we depend on our own power backup which is maintained by the RWA. Apartment layout is not efficient because you will not find 2 washrooms in a 2 BHK flat which you need and where there are two bathrooms ,none of them is attached and many times you see the washroom and bathroom is separate. Somehow it is not adequate. I will say the society is a bit senior citizen friendly. The society is pet-friendly so no worries about the pet.",

They do not interfere with anything and they do not restrict for anything like for time bound etc. Second reason for staying here was that I like the parking in our flat.We have about three to five cars so the parking is never an issue here.Senior citizens sit here and do get-together, meetings, and all. The society is bachelor friendly.Security is very good the reason is that where my house is,its a closed locality with only one way where there is a gate and security guards always available 24*7. There is a garden here like a plot for children where they can play. Parks are here in which slides & swings are there which is quite near to my house.There is a lot of greenery but the maintenance is not so good. It is naturally green but no one does planting over here. Parking is excellent with ample parking space being available as you do not have to fight for parking. Infrastructure is not so good as it is a developing area so construction is going on and the roads are ok.",

Security is good too.THe strretlights are quite low hanging so there is darkness on the road so if you want to go anywhere then you will think twice before going. On Sector 42, there are so many empty small grounds, because of that, we can say the area is not that much safe.

There\u2019s a conference hall here wherein festive celebration and other functions are celebrated, it\u2019s free of charge for every resident of this society but any outsider has to pay some fee to book this hall for any function and around 2000rs is paid in advance during the booking of this hall for any outsider. The conference hall accommodates around 250-300 people. The security here is the best here as there are guards 24x7, even at every tower and parking lots. There CCTV cameras installed are functional 24x7 and proper visitor and vehicle verification is conducted,we feel really comfortable and secure here.We don\u2019t face any issue with parking as every house has been allotted with 2 car parking space. Visitor parking space is also available but sometimes there\u2019s some problem,otherwise you don\u2019t face any challenges for parking here and the parking is area is maintained quite well. There\u2019s sufficient open and green areas here and these place are always clean and well maintained. There\u2019s a really good badminton court which is maintained quite well and you\u2019ll see every age group using the court. The construction quality of the buildings and roads are really good and they are properly maintained,in addition to this there\u2019s 100% power backup available but when there\u2019s power cut the power backup takes 30sec time limit to start. Maids are very easily available for rs2500/- per month and the place is senior citizen friendly as the RWA has provided a place for senior citizens with chairs where they can come and socialise. Relatively speaking this is an absolute perfect place for a family to live.",
